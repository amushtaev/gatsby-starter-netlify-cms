      'Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Whether you upgrade or downgrade, your unused video downloads for your current plan will be added to the allotment for your new plan. Unused video downloads will be available for a month if you’re switching from a plan that’s billed monthly or for a year if you’re switching from a plan that’s billed annually.',

    question: 'What if I want to download only one video ad?',
    answer:
      'Sorry, but we don’t offer single video plans. One video ad isn’t enough to run a successful marketing campaign. You need to be flexible and use different videos for different audiences. If you’re just getting started, we recommend you subscribe to our Basic plan.',
