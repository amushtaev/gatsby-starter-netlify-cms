In the age when you can shoot HD or 4K video with your phone in a pocket, everyone has become a creator. Deep inside, every creator has a dream of getting famous and collecting an army of followers. But ultimately, when creators forget about such dreams, they remember the true reason for creating content — to have fun with the process and, even more than that, to share their content with others.

If you’re considering using TikTok advertising for your business, you’ve probably visited the platform and understood its beautiful gimmicks. TikTok did what other platforms couldn’t do or didn’t even think about. It combined things that were considered incompatible on other platforms.

That’s why TikTok has made it to the top of social media this quickly.

![TikTok advertising — app downloads](/img/tiktok-advertising-app-downloads.jpg)

In March 2020, TikTok reached [76 million monthly app downloads](https://www.statista.com/chart/22890/global-monthly-downloads-social-media-apps/) globally, which is likely to make it the most downloaded app of the year according to Ainnow Data.

Compared to 2018, the number of TikTok users in the United States [skyrocketed 97.5%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100842/tiktok-us-user-growth/) in 2019.

In September 2019, TikTok became the second most used mobile app in the United States after Facebook with US users spending an average of nearly [500 minutes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579358/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-engagement/) in the app. In March 2020, this monthly average almost doubled to [858 minutes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115136/tiktok-user-engagement-monthly-usa/).

## How to Create TikTok Advertising

After TikTok disrupted the way people share video, TikTok advertising gained tremendous popularity among businesses and brands.

![TikTok advertising — sponsored content boost](/img/tiktok-advertising-sponsored-content-boost.jpg)

According to the [2020 State of Influence Report](https://www.traackr.com/blog/announcing-the-2020-state-of-influence) by Traackr, TikTok took the cake in advertising between the first half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, leaving major social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter way behind:

* Paid active influencers on TikTok increased by 368%
* Sponsored posts increased by 95%
* Engagements with sponsored posts increased by 298%

To run TikTok advertising, you need to create a TikTok Ads Manager account.

If you’re already familiar with major ad platforms like Facebook Ads Manager, you’ll learn how to run ads on TikTok really fast, as [TikTok Ads Manager](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/apps/tiktok) works pretty much the same way.

![TikTok advertising — TikTok Ads Manager dashboard](/img/tiktok-advertising-ads-manager-dashboard.jpg)

To create a TikTok advertising campaign, you need to set:

* Marketing objectives. Just as in [Facebook Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/), all goals in TikTok Ads Manager are divided into three major groups: Awareness, Consideration, and Conversions. To learn more about them, read [this article](https://softcube.com/major-marketing-objective-examples-for-rookie-advertisers/).
* Placements. The same as Google and Facebook, TikTok has their own family of apps called [placements](https://softcube.com/how-to-place-ads-on-facebook-ad-placements/), i.e. places where your TikTok ads can appear.
* Audiences. You can form audiences using different targeting options based on users’ demographics and devices or create [Custom Audiences](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-custom-audiences/) and [Lookalike Audiences](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-facebook-lookalike-audiences/) to target users who have the same characteristics as your current customers.
* Budgets. There are two types of budgets you can set for your TikTok ad campaigns. A lifetime budget is spent during the period you define. The daily budget is spent during one day.

After you customize these settings, you also need to upload and customize your TikTok advertisement videos or images. And that’s all — your TikTok ads are ready to go live! Once you launch your ads, you can monitor their performance on the TikTok Ads Manager dashboard.

## How Much Does It Cost to Advertise on TikTok?

Compared to other ad platforms where you can start advertising for a few dollars, the TikTok advertising cost may hit you in the pocket.

The minimum ad cost on TikTok is:

* $50 for the ad campaign level
* $20 for the ad group level

If you use the lifetime budget option, TikTok will calculate your lifetime budget as the minimum daily budget (which is $20) multiplied by the number of days for which you schedule your ads. For example, if you run ads for 17 days, you’ll need to pay $340.

The amount of money you spend depends on the bidding type you choose. There are five bidding types on TikTok:

* Cost per click (CPC). Set the amount you want to pay per click made by a user.
* Optimized cost per click (oCPC). Set the amount you want to pay per action taken by a user.
* Cost per thousand impressions or cost per mille (CPM). Set the amount you want to pay per one thousand impressions.
* Optimized cost per mille (oCPM). Set the amount you want to pay per one thousand impressions that lead to conversions.
* Cost per thousand views (CPV). Set the amount you want to pay per one thousand views of a 6-second or 2-second video.

Note that your bidding type is defined by your campaign goal.

TikTok Advertising Best Practices

If you’re ready to test TikTok advertising for your business, there are a few golden rules you need to know. Here’s how to do TikTok ads the right way:

### Be Real and Natural

TikTok is booming on the media landscape because it has one distinctive difference compared to other platforms — it revolutionized video sharing by making it frivolous. To succeed with your TikTok videos, you should come as you are.

The simpler your posts and ads, the better the response they’ll get. Breaking the fourth wall is the best way to be simple. Consider your marketing not as producing professional video content but a direct face-to-face communication with every customer.

### Find the Right Moment and Play

On TikTok, naturalness goes hand in hand with straightforwardness. To successfully promote your products or services, you should mention them in the first seconds before viewers skip your ad.

However, if you need to boost your brand awareness, don’t draw your viewers’ attention to products or services. Viewers don’t like ads; they like stories. Produce content in a playful format, entertain your audience, and amuse yourself!

### Use the Full-Screen Vertical Format

TikTok is a mobile app, and you should use a [vertical video format](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-vertical-video-ads-on-facebook/) as an advertising and content standard. It will help you reduce the distance between your business and viewers by creating the effect of personal presence.

### Add a 120 BPM Soundtrack

When you create a TikTok advertising video, you should remember that the soundtrack is just as important as the video footage. While [85% of Facebook users](https://softcube.com/70-video-marketing-statistics-for-2020/) watch video content with the sound off, users on TikTok are used to enjoying content with the sound on because sound is an integral part of storytelling on the platform.

TikTok recommends making videos with fast-paced soundtracks that are higher than 120 beats per minute (BPM) because such videos usually get more views than those with music slower than 120 BPM.

### Collaborate with TikTok Influencers

Another way to use TikTok to boost your conversions and sales is by attracting the followers of TikTok creators who have already gained popularity on the platform. Creators are recognized, and they know how to advertise on TikTok. If you clearly explain to them what you want to achieve using the platform and give them the right direction, they’ll guide users to your business.

### Follow the Latest Trends on TikTok and Beyond

It’s important to follow the hottest news and creative trends both on TikTok and in the world. In such a way, you’ll be able to think out captivating and, more importantly, relevant ideas for your TikTok ad content.

![TikTok advertising — most popular content categories](/img/tiktok-advertising-most-popular-content-categories.png)

As of June 2020, the [top eleven categories](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130988/most-popular-categories-tiktok-worldwide-hashtag-views/) of TikTok content by hashtag views were:
