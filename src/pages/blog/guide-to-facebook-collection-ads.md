Ready to run some advertising on Facebook? Sounds great!

Your Facebook ads can take many different forms depending on your marketing objective, target audience, and other criteria. In total, there are nearly [ten Facebook ad formats](https://softcube.com/how-to-select-types-of-facebook-ads/) you can use in your campaigns.

The Facebook Collection format is one of them.

## What are Facebook Collection Ads?

Facebook Collection ads are posts that contain one main video or image above four smaller images. Collection ads use a grid-like layout powered by [Instant Experience](https://softcube.com/how-to-get-started-with-facebook-instant-experience/) (previously called Canvas). According to Facebook, Instant Experience is up to fifteen times faster than mobile web.

3. Drive people to a website or app where they can browse more products to boost your sales even more.
4. Add a URL parameter to your Carousel ad to be able to track the number of people who click on the link to your website.
5. Showcase multiple products on each of your four Carousel images to give your audience a broader choice.
