Want to know exactly when you should target users on Facebook? Here’s the thing.

According to The Verge Tech Survey 2020, almost [10% of people](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple) don’t use Facebook because of advertising.

The right ads delivered to the right people at the right time do magic and make people (and the Facebook team) happier, even if these people don’t like seeing ads.

But if something is wrong with this formula, happiness gives way to annoyance, which eventually pushes people away and reduces the number of active Facebook users.

Let’s shed light on how you can calculate the best time to post Facebook ads in order to boost your return on investment and improve your customers’ experience with your business on the world’s top social media platform.

Here are three things you should always remember:

## Only You Know the Best Time to Run Facebook Ads

If you try to google the best days to advertise on Facebook, you’ll stumble upon lots of advertisers and agencies who share different insights.

They can name the exact days, like Tuesday or Thursday, and the exact hours, like between 1 PM and 4 PM.

They could be right, and you can even test [their recommendations](https://softcube.com/creating-effective-facebook-ads/) to see.

However, keep in mind that these conclusions were arrived at based on factors such as an industry, location, and advertising goal that may have nothing to do with your business and marketing.

The first thing you should remember when searching for the best time to advertise on Facebook is that **_you and your team are the only people who can know what the best time is for your business_**. 

And the best way to find the best time is to focus on your audience.

## It’s All About Your Target Audience

Do you know your customers’ needs, habits, and preferences? Then you’ll easily know the best time to run Facebook ads! And if the behavior of your [target audience](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-ad-targeting/) isn’t clear to you, there are two major Facebook sources that can help you discover that.

### Data Source 1. Facebook Business Page

If you often post about your business in the News Feed, you can see when your fans are online, track the number of people engaged with your Facebook posts, and see other important data.

To do that, go to your [Facebook Page](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-pages-you-should-follow/) and click **Insights** on the panel at the top.

### Data Source 2. Facebook Business Manager

Facebook Business Manager allows you to promote your business across the entire Facebook family of apps and services. Thanks to this platform, you can find the best time to post Instagram ads, Messenger ads, Audience Network ads, and Facebook ads.

There are [several tools inside Business Manager](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-ad-tools/) you should use.

The first tool is **Ads Reporting**, which allows you to create, share, customize, and export reports to understand your ad performance.

The second tool is **Analytics**, which allows you to monitor all kinds of activity across Facebook and its placements.

The third tool is **Events Manager**, which allows you to use data received from Facebook Pixel if you drive users to your website, Offline Events if you have a brick-and-mortar business, and App Events if you promote your mobile app.

We’ve already mentioned these data sources in our [Timesaving Guide to Scheduling Facebook Ads](https://softcube.com/timesaving-guide-to-facebook-ad-scheduling/).

## Experiment to Gain Experience

The third thing you need to do to know the best time to launch Facebook ads is to experiment with different times. Testing will help you collect priceless information not only on ad scheduling but on budgeting, targeting, and other factors that affect your conversions.

To run experiments, follow these four steps:

**Step 1**. Go to [Facebook Business Manager](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager/) or [Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/).

**Step 2**. Open the dropdown menu.

**Step 4**. Choose your test.

There are four types of tests you can launch to find the best days to run ads on Facebook:

1. **A/B tests** allow you to experiment with multiple ad campaigns, ad sets, and ads, run them at different times, and see what times work best.
2. **Holdout tests** will help you compare people who have seen your ads with people who have never seen your ads to discover the overall impact of your ad campaigns.
3. **Brand surveys** are a great way to ask your customers when they prefer to receive messages and offers from your business.
4. **Campaign budget optimization tests** show how budget optimization affects your ad delivery.

## Take Advantage of Artificial Intelligence to Know Your Time

Let’s recap. To find the best time for [Instagram ads](https://softcube.com/recommendations-for-instagram-sponsored-ads/), Facebook ads, [Messenger ads](https://softcube.com/how-to-start-a-personal-chat-with-messenger-ads/), and [Audience Network ads](https://softcube.com/facebook-audience-network-complete-guide/), you need to remember three things.

First, the best way to know the best time to run Facebook ads is to use your own data instead of someone else’s insights.

Second, to use your data, you need to know your target audience.

Third, you should experiment with your ads on an ongoing basis after examining your target audience.

And don’t forget that you can use [artificial intelligence to make video ads](https://softcube.com/) for your tests. That way you’ll get a greater return on your investments from the beginning. Good luck!
