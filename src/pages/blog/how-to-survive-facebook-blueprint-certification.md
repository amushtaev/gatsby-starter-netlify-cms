## Cost of Facebook Advertising Certification

The Facebook Blueprint Certification cost will be about $300 in total. This cost includes $150 for each exam, but the final price may vary depending on your country. You can pay for exams using AMEX, Visa, or Mastercard.

You can reschedule or cancel an exam within 24 hours of registering for the exam. If you do, you’ll get your money back. But If you fail an exam and want to retake it, you’ll have to pay the total Facebook certification cost for the exam again.

**Note:** A Blueprint Certificate is valid for one year.

## Three tips for passing Facebook Ads Certification

How can you pass the certifications successfully? First, don’t cheat. Second, follow the Blueprint Certification requirements. We’ve prepared three simple but useful tips for passing Facebook Blueprint exams that will help you when taking your exams.

### Plan ahead

Before the exam, enter a room, close the door, and take away distracting things: electronic devices, watches, wallets, bags, books, notebooks, and outerwear.

A proctor must verify your identity before you begin each test. To prove your identity, you have to show a passport, driving license, green card, identification card, or another official document. Then the proctor will check your workplace through the webcam. Prepare a separate webcam to show your room if you’re using a laptop camera.

You need to be able to communicate with the proctor. The exams are available in English, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.

![facebook blueprint certification - plan ahead](/img/facebook-blueprint-certification-plan-ahead.jpg)

### Don’t be a chatterbox

A Facebook Blueprint exam isn’t the right time to chat with anyone, including your proctor. A proctor isn’t allowed to disclose any exam content.

You can only get technical support or ask about the examination process through the proctor chat. You can’t use your mobile phone except to reach a proctor in case of emergency.

Remember that nobody can enter your room when you’re taking an exam online and you can’t ask your friends for help.

![facebook blueprint certification - chatterbox](/img/facebook-blueprint-certification-chatterbox.jpg)

### Be honest

Before starting an exam, you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement that obligates you not to copy, reproduce, distribute, or publish exam materials and questions before, during, or after the exam. If you violate the agreement, you won’t be able to get certified for three years.
