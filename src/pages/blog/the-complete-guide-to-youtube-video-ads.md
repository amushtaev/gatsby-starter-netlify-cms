Have you watched a YouTube video today? Your answer is more than likely yes.

If you haven’t gotten your daily dose of YouTube content, go watch [Tommy Tucker’s Tooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rwvx0FDA_8), produced by Walt Disney in 1922:

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rwvx0FDA_8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Now you’re wondering: What’s so important about this black and white silent movie?

Surprisingly, it looks like typical YouTube content. But what’s more important is that it was the first film in the genre of educational entertainment, or edutainment — a term which is believed to have been coined by Walt Disney himself.

As the world’s largest video platform de jure and the world’s second largest search engine de facto, YouTube is a primary medium for modern edutainment. Creators and brands upload [more than 82 years’ worth](https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/07/number-hours-video-uploaded-to-youtube-per-minute/) of YouTube video and YouTube video ads every single day.

![YouTube video ads — the Library of Congress](/img/youtube-video-ads-library-of-congress.png)

According to ThinkwithGoogle, as of 2017 there were already [more educational videos on YouTube](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/learning-related-youtube-statistics/) than books in the Library of Congress, which is the largest library in the world.

![YouTube video ads — 500 million views](/img/youtube-video-ads-500m-views.png)

To be precise, educational content on YouTube gets [half a billion views](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/learning-related-youtube-content-statistics/) every day. For comparison, the collection in the Library of Congress amounts to around 170 million items.

![YouTube video ads — viewers with problems](/img/youtube-video-ads-7-in-10-viewers.png)

According to the [Values of YouTube study](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/self-directed-learning-youtube-work-study-hobbies/) by Google, YouTube helps 7 in 10 monthly viewers learn things related to their work, studies, and hobbies.

Google wants viewers to stay on YouTube as long as possible. The only way to do that is to find the right video content for each viewer. And the YouTube recommendations algorithm copes with this task pretty well.

![YouTube video ads — YouTube algorithm](/img/youtube-video-ads-youtube-algorithm.jpg)

Everyone admits that the algorithm is legendary — for two reasons: because nobody knows exactly how it works and because it can keep you awake until 3 am even if you realize you have something important to do in the morning.

In 2016, Google released a paper called [Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations](https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/), in which software engineers Paul Covington, Jay Adams, and Emre Sargin explain the role of machine learning in YouTube’s video recommendation system.

![YouTube video ads — YouTube revenue](/img/youtube-video-ads-ad-revenue.jpg)

In 2017, advertisers who used Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) for YouTube video ads brought Alphabet Inc. $8.15 billion in revenue according to Statista.

By 2019, that ad revenue had [almost doubled](https://www.statista.com/chart/20698/youtube-ads-revenue/) to $15.15 billion.

Coincidence? We think not!

## YouTube Video Ads: The Complete Tutorial for First-Timers

If you have difficulties creating YouTube video ads for your business, this tutorial will help you come up with YouTube advertising that will make viewers forget about buying a Premium account.

We’ll go through everything you need to know: ad formats, specifications and requirements, the ad creation process, and best practices.

At the end of this article, you’ll discover how you can take advantage of artificial intelligence to boost the effectiveness of your YouTube video ads strategy.

Let’s roll!

## The YouTube Ad Formats You Need to Know

Before we highlight the advertising formats for YouTube video ads, here’s a little reminder. Just in case you didn’t know, Google Ads allows advertisers to run more than just video ads on YouTube.

In addition to the ad formats you’ll see below, keep in mind that you can take advantage of two more non-video advertising types.

![YouTube video ads — Overlay ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-overlay-ads.jpg)

The first non-video ad type is Overlay ads, which can be launched on the Google Ads platform as Image ads that appear on YouTube video watch pages.

![](/img/youtube-video-ads-display-ads.jpg)

The second non-video type is Display ads that appear across YouTube. Note that neither of these ad types is served to mobile devices.

Here are the types of YouTube video ads available so far:

### TrueView In-Stream Video Ads

TrueView in-stream video ads play before, in the middle of, or after YouTube videos. Viewers can skip these ads five seconds in.

![YouTube video ads — Trueview in-stream video ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-trueview-ads.jpg)

Depending on your advertising strategy, there are several types of TrueView ads you can use for your ad campaigns.

### TrueView for Reach Ads

TrueView for reach ads are TrueView in-stream ads designed to efficiently expand reach and drive awareness using a cost-per-impression (CPM) bidding model.

### TrueView for Action Ads

TrueView for action ads motivate viewers to take action with the help of a call-to-action button, headline, and auto end screen in the ad creative. Additionally, this TrueView video ad type allows advertisers to add a link to a website or lead form.

![YouTube video ads — TrueView for action ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-trueview-for-action-ads.jpg)

### TrueView Discovery Ads

TrueView discovery ads appear along with videos people discover on sources such as YouTube mobile and desktop search results, YouTube mobile and desktop video watch pages, and YouTube mobile and desktop home pages.

![YouTube video ads — TrueView discovery ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-discovery-ads.jpg)

### TrueView for Shopping Ads

TrueView for shopping ads are TrueView in-stream ads that provide viewers with an instant shopping experience by featuring cards of products shown or products related to the video they’re watching.

![YouTube video ads — TrueView for shopping ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-shopping-ads.jpg)

Product images and information for TrueView shopping ads are pulled from an ad account linked to [Google Merchant Center](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/merchant-center/) to which the advertiser has uploaded these images and information.

### Non-Skippable In-Stream Ads

Non-skippable in-stream ads show up before, during, or after videos on YouTube and last 15 seconds or less. The purpose of this format is to attract new customers at the [consideration stage](https://softcube.com/the-complete-tutorial-to-marketing-funnel-stages/) of the marketing funnel.

### Bumper Ads

Bumper ads are non-skippable videos that last up to six seconds.

![YouTube video ads — Bumper ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-bumper-ads.jpg)

Using the CPM bidding model, this YouTube video ad format is perfect for attracting viewers at a greater reach with quick, catchy messages.

### Masthead Ads

Masthead ads autoplay at the top of the YouTube home feed on desktop, smartphone, and TV screens. Depending on the screen type, a Masthead ad has a different appearance.

![YouTube video ads — Masthead ads](/img/youtube-video-ads-masthead-ads.jpg)

This YouTube ad format is great for reaching a huge audience of leads who have never heard of a business or brand or a large number of current customers who are more likely to buy products or services during a sale.

## YouTube Video Ad Specifications and Requirements

In this part of the tutorial, we’ve collected the major YouTube video ad specs and requirements you need to be aware of before creating and editing your video advertising content.

### Supported YouTube Video Ad File Formats

Here’s the full list of video file formats supported by YouTube:

* 3GPP
* AVI
* CineForm
* DNxHR
* FLV
* HEVC (H.265)
* MP4
* MPEG4
* MPEGPS
* MOV
* ProRes
* WebM
* WMV

### YouTube Video Encoding Settings

If you need more advanced video specifications, YouTube recommends the following encoding settings for your videos:

**Container**

When uploading content, YouTube recommends content creators use the MP4 container with the moov atom at the front of the file (Fast Start) and with no edit lists because they might cause the video to be processed incorrectly.

**Audio Codec**

The most suitable audio codec for YouTube videos is AAC-LC with a sample rate of 96kHz or 48kHz and powered by stereo or stereo 5.1+.

**Video Codec**

The best video codec for YouTube video content is H.264 high profile with progressive scan (no interlacing), two consecutive B frames, a closed group of pictures (GOP), GOP of half the frame rate, context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), variable bitrate, and 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.

**Frame Rate**

You should encode and upload videos in the same frame rate in which they were recorded. Recommended frame rates are 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, and 60 frames per second. However, other frame rates are also acceptable.

If you upload interlaced content, make sure you deinterlace it before uploading. For instance, if you’re going to use 1080i60 video, you should deinterlace it to 1080p30.

**Bitrate**

Below are recommended bitrates for standard dynamic-range (SDR) video. Note that to see 4K uploads in 4K, you need to use a device or browser that supports the VP9 video encoding format.

| Type       | Video Bitrate, Standard Video Rate (24, 25, 30) | Video Bitrate, High Frame Rate (48, 50, 60) |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 2160p (4K) | 35–45 Mbps                                      | 53–68 Mbps                                  |
| 1440p (2K) | 16 Mbps                                         | 24 Mbps                                     |
| 1080p      | 8 Mbps                                          | 12 Mbps                                     |
| 720p       | 5 Mbps                                          | 7.5 Mbps                                    |
| 480p       | 2.5 Mbps                                        | 4 Mbps                                      |
| 240p       | 1 Mbps                                          | 1.5 Mbps                                    |

Here are the recommended bitrates for **high dynamic range (HDR)** video:

| Type       | Video Bitrate, Standard Video Rate (24, 25, 30) | Video Bitrate, High Frame Rate (48, 50, 60) |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 2160p (4K) | 44-56 Mbps                                      | 66–85 Mbps                                  |
| 1440p (2K) | 20 Mbps                                         | 30 Mbps                                     |
| 1080p      | 10 Mbps                                         | 15 Mbps                                     |
| 720p       | 6.5 Mbps                                        | 9.5 Mbps                                    |
| 480p       | Not supported                                   | Not supported                               |
| 240p       | Not supported                                   | Not supported                               |

Here are the recommended audio bitrates:

| Type   | Audio Bitrate |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Mono   | 128 kbps      |
| Stereo | 384 kbps      |
| 5.1    | 512 kbps      |

**Resolution and Aspect Ratio**

The standard aspect ratio for YouTube videos displayed on desktop and laptop computers is 16:9. For vertical and square aspect ratios, the YouTube player automatically adjusts itself to the size of the uploaded video.

Here are recommended resolutions for the 16:9 aspect ratio:

* **2160p:** 3840x2160
* **1440p:** 2560x1440
* **1080p:** 1920x1080
* **720p:** 1280x720
* **480p:** 854x480
* **360p:** 640x360
* **240p:** 426x240

**Color Space**

The recommended color space for SDR videos on YouTube is BT.709.

| Color Space | Color Transfer Characteristics (TRC) | Color Primaries        | Color Matrix Coefficients |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| BT.709      | BT.709 (H.273 value: 1)              | BT.709 (H.273 value 1) | T.709 (H.273 value 1)     |

### Duration of YouTube Video Ads

The maximum YouTube video ad duration for non-skippable in-stream ads is 15 seconds.

There’s no limit to skippable in-stream ads, but YouTube recommends uploading video ads that are less than three minutes long.

### YouTube Video Ad Policies

YouTube ad videos must be uploaded in a supported video format.

All uploaded videos must be publicly available.

All content in the video ad should be relevant to the advertised product or service.

Video content must not have blurry, unclear, or unrecognizable visuals, poor sound quality, or illegible text.

To advertise video content, you must own the copyright or be legally authorized to use the content.

## How to Start a YouTube Video Ad Campaign

Now we’re going to review ad campaign opportunities you can use on Google Ads for your YouTube videos. Keep in mind that you need to do three things before getting started.

Obviously, the first thing you need to do is create a Google Ads account if you don’t already have one.

![YouTube video ads — conversion tracking](/img/youtube-video-ads-conversion-tracking.png)

If you already have a Google Ads account, the first thing you should do is set up conversion tracking for your website in order to track actions of people who interact with your YouTube video ads. If you don’t set up conversion tracking, you simply won’t be able to create your video campaign.

Finally, don’t forget to link your Google Ads account to your YouTube channel to show ads based on interactions with your channel videos.

Let’s see how to create a YouTube video ad and what the differences are in creating campaigns for different types of video ads on YouTube.

### How to Start a TrueView In-Stream Ad Campaign

![YouTube video ads — Conversions](/img/youtube-video-ads-conversions.png)

**Step 3.** In the Campaigns window, start a new campaign.

**Step 5.** Pick the **Influence consideration** campaign subtype and click Continue.

![YouTube video ads — Networks checkbox](/img/youtube-video-ads-networks-checkbox.png)

After you name your TrueView discovery ad campaign as well as set a budget and bidding for it, proceed to the Networks tab and uncheck the Video partners on the Display Network box to avoid displaying your video ads on Google partners’ websites.

In this way, you’ll show your TrueView discovery ads solely on YouTube.

Basically, that’s everything you need to know about creating a TrueView discovery ad campaign on YouTube. After finishing customizing your ad campaign, you’re free to launch your TrueView discovery ads.

### How to Start a Masthead Ad Campaign

We’ve got good news and bad news for you.

The bad news is that right now, Masthead ads are available only on a reservation basis. That means you need to directly contact a Google sales representative if you want to create a YouTube Masthead ad campaign.

The good news is that if you’re one of those people who are wondering how much do YouTube video ads cost? (it always depends on a zillion factors, and you never know until you try yourself), you’ll be pleased to know that YouTube charges for impressions from Masthead ads at a fixed price.

One more important YouTube video ad campaign type to mention is video ad sequencing.

### How to Start a Video Ad Sequencing Campaign

Video ad sequencing is a type of YouTube video ad campaign that allows you to demonstrate a few video ad types simultaneously in the order defined in a ready-made template.

To start a video ad sequence campaign, you need to pick a campaign goal that supports the video campaign type.

![YouTube video ads — Ad sequence campaign subtype](/img/youtube-video-ads-ad-sequence.jpg)

After you customize the campaign settings such as budget, targeting, and language, you need to pick one of the video ad sequence templates.

![YouTube video ads — Ad sequence templates](/img/youtube-video-ads-ad-sequence-templates.jpg)

There are four video ad sequence templates you can use:

1. **Introduce & reinforce** allows you to present your business or brand with a long video ad and then strengthen your message with a short video ad.
2. **Prompt & inspire** is the opposite to the introduce & reinforce template. First, you show a short video ad and run a long video ad afterwards.
3. **Attract & direct** is the advanced version of the prompt & inspire template. First, you lure people with a short video ad. Second, you get people interested in your business or brand with a long video ad. Third, you call viewers to action with one more short video ad.
4. **Engage & differentiate** is the best way to tell an engaging story from different points of view with four short video ads.

If these templates don’t meet your needs, you can create a custom video ad sequence.

For video ad sequencing campaigns, you can run TrueView skippable in-stream ads, non-skippable in-stream ads, and bumper ads.

## Best Practices for YouTube Video Ads

Here are some of the basic YouTube video ads best practices you need to know.

### Personalize Your Ad Copy

Don’t underestimate the power of the copy in your YouTube video ads.

![YouTube video ads — ad copy](/img/youtube-video-ads-ad-copy.jpg)

When you personalize headlines, descriptions, and call to action buttons, you make your message memorable and provide viewers with more information about your business, product, service, or whatever you’re advertising.

### Narrow Your Targeting and Reach

YouTube connects users to video content based on their personal interests.

This is why you can target very specific audiences using relevant keywords, topics, and placements related to your potential customers, business, and industry.

You should target as narrow an audience as possible because the narrower your audience is, the more interactions your ads get and the less money you spend on them. Not to mention that when you show relevant advertising content to a narrow audience using Google Ads, YouTube video ads feel more natural.

If you don’t know who your target audience is, the [Find Your Audience](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/findmyaudience/) tool will help you identify your average YouTube viewer.

### Create Shorter Ads That Spark Instant Interest

People on YouTube stumble upon dozens of videos and video ads every day. They’re busy treasure seekers going through jungles really fast in order to find something they don’t really know.

The only way to make these seekers stop is to make your treasures noticeable in the blink of an eye. Obviously, the shorter your video ads are, the more treasure seekers will notice your treasures.

### Run Retargeting Campaigns

One of the greatest benefits of YouTube video ads is that all actions taken by viewers who interact with your YouTube channel and YouTube advertisements are tracked by the platform.

Based on this data, you can create YouTube user lists and retarget these people to remind them about your business or brand.

Also, you can take advantage of Customer Match lists that include potential and existing customers whose contact information you received outside YouTube.

## Make YouTube Video Ads with Artificial Intelligence

Now to our final recommendation for your YouTube ads.

Keep in mind that YouTube video ads work best when launched on a large scale. It’s the only way to understand how your YouTube video ad strategy is supposed to work — or whether it works at all.

With [Softcube](https://softcube.com/), you can create professional and appealing video ads for YouTube in a few clicks using a user-friendly interface, a set of easy-to-use video editing tools, and lots of predesigned video templates.

If you don’t have any professional footage, paste your website link and the Softcube artificial intelligence engine will find the most suitable videos related to your product, service, and industry from a rich collection of high-quality stock video content.
