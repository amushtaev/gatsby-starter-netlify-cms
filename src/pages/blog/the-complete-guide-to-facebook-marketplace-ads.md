## Why Should You Advertise on Facebook Marketplace?

[Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) as we know it today was introduced in 2016 as a response to the growing number of Facebook Groups where users bought and sold anything they wanted with no third party.

At the 2018 Facebook F8 Developer Conference, Mark Zuckerberg said that there were [800 million people](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-marketplace-is-used-in-70-countries-by-800-million-people-monthly/) who used Facebook Marketplace in 70 countries around the world.

According to a [survey conducted by Bizrate Insights](https://www.statista.com/statistics/275788/share-of-facebook-user-activities/), nearly 17% of respondents visit Facebook to shop or buy things from Facebook Marketplace.

According to Facebook, [one in three users in the United States](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/marketplace-ecommerce) uses Marketplace each month to buy and sell things.

If you’ve already listed your own products (you should!) and now you’re wondering how to advertise on Facebook Marketplace, here’s what you need to get started.

## What You Need Before Launching Facebook Marketplace Ads

If you want to not only launch Facebook Marketplace ads but understand their impact on your e-commerce business, you’ll need to do several things. 

### Create a Facebook Business Manager Account

[Facebook Business Manager](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager/) contains all the necessary business tools to post ads on Facebook Marketplace, measure their performance, and analyze the outcomes for further marketing optimization. 

![Facebook Marketplace ads — Business Manager](/img/facebook-marketplace-ads-business-manager.jpg)

Let’s name these tools:

- [Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/) is the platform where you’ll manage your Facebook Marketplace ads.
- [Analytics](https://analytics.facebook.com/) allows you to think over your future ad campaigns based on data you receive from your ads.
- [Attribution](https://www.facebook.com/business/measurement/attribution) lets you see your customers’ entire sales path from the moment they click on your ad to the moment they land on your online shop to purchase your products.
- Events Manager is where you can analyze the influence of your Facebook ads on your website traffic (see more information below).

There are lots of [Facebook tools you might not have heard of](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-ad-tools/), but the ones we’ve just mentioned are crucial for professionally launching, running, and testing your Facebook Marketplace ads.

### Set Up Facebook Pixel (or Facebook SDK) and Facebook Pixel Events

If you want to advertise on Facebook Marketplace and see who clicks on your Facebook Marketplace ads, when, and how often, you should add [Facebook pixel](https://softcube.com/what-is-facebook-pixel-and-why-use-it/) code to your website or Facebook SDK code to your mobile app.

This code not only allows you to understand whether you’re showing your ads to the right people but enables you to target [Custom Audiences](https://softcube.com/facebook-audience-network-complete-guide/) and [Lookalike Audiences](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-facebook-lookalike-audiences/). Additionally, it enables you to launch [Dynamic Ads](https://softcube.com/facebook-dynamic-product-ads/) that are generated automatically.

Along with [creating a Facebook pixel](https://softcube.com/how-to-create-a-facebook-pixel/) or using the Facebook SDK, you should set up code that allows you to track events — users’ actions on your website or mobile app triggered by your Facebook marketing ads. 

After you add pixel (or Facebook SDK) and event tracking codes to your website (or your mobile app), you’ll be able to monitor the behavior of your potential and current customers in Events Manager.

## How to Create Ads for Facebook Marketplace

After you create an ad account in Facebook Business Manager and install Facebook ad tracking software, you’re ready to launch your first Facebook Marketplace ad campaign.

Selecting Automatic Placements lets Facebook choose placements for you. In fact, Automatic Placements are recommended for beginners who need time to discover which placements meet their needs.
