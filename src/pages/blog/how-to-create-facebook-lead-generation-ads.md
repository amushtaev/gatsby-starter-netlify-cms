There are nearly a [dozen ways](https://softcube.com/how-to-select-types-of-facebook-ads/) to attract new customers from Facebook to your website, landing page, and mobile app. All of them are effective for achieving different ad objectives.  

Still, none guarantee that the users who come to your website or app will become leads. None, that is, except for Facebook lead ads.

## What Are Facebook Lead Ads?

Lead ads on Facebook and Instagram is an ad format that allows any business or agency to convert a user into a customer with a premade form that instantly pops out of an ad when a user taps or clicks on it.

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — Centerline Drivers](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-centerline-drivers-1.jpg)

The form can include both prefilled and custom questions to collect customer data such as emails, phone numbers, and names.

## Why Should You Use Facebook lead ads?

You should try Facebook lead generation ads if you want to:  

- search for new customers
- inform current customers about upcoming sales and special discounts
- increase registrations for your service or event
- learn the habits and interests of your target audience
- offer users free content such as brochures and e-books

You can use lead generation ads to ask any question you want except for ones that request the following information (without Facebook’s written permission):  

- Frequent flyer, telephone, cable, or loyalty card account numbers
- Criminal and arrest history
- Financial information such as credit card, debit card, and bank account numbers, credit history, and income
- Social security, passport, and driver’s license numbers
- Health information
- Insurance policy numbers
- Information about religion or philosophical beliefs, race, ethnicity, sexual life, and sexual orientation
- Trade union membership
- Usernames and passwords

Let’s find out how to create a Facebook Lead Ad.

## How to Сreate Facebook Lead Generation Ads

There are several methods of creating Facebook lead ads.

### From Your Facebook Page

## 10 Facebook Lead Ads Best Practices

When creating Facebook lead ads, remember three important benchmarks:  

- **Short**. Ask simple questions without overwhelming your audience.
- **Clear**. Make your questions easy to answer.
- **Valuable**. Make a good offer in your ad.

#### **Add a Privacy Policy Link**

This is a requirement for creating lead ads. You need to [add a link](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740?helpref=page_content) to your company’s privacy policy to show your ads and legally collect data on your potential and current customers.

#### **Choose All Required Pre-Filled Fields**

There are four types of pre-filled fields available for your lead ad:  

\[table id=4 /\]

If you’re going to run lead ads on Instagram, read the part below.

#### **Run lead ads on Instagram**

Instagram lead ads have a few restrictions compared to Facebook lead ads.  

1. Instagram offers fewer prefilled fields: name, email, phone number, and gender. If you add more fields, users will have to fill them in themselves.
2. Instagram users need to go through several pages to fill in a form, while Facebook users can do it by scrolling down one page.
3. Instagram lead ads aren’t available on Instagram’s desktop version.

There are also peculiarities with ad specifications.  

#### **Pick The Form Type for The Right Goal**

Choosing the form type is the first step in creating a form.

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — form type](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-form-type.jpg)

There are two options:  

- **More Volume**. This is simpler, requiring minimum effort from your potential customers. If you need to get emails or increase the number of registrations, this option is for you.
- **Higher Intent**. These forms are more detailed due to the larger number of fields. Also, users can check their info before sending it to you. This option is available only for Facebook Feed on mobile devices. It’s for you if you plan to contact every user personally.

Don’t forget that each form type will work more effectively with a customized welcoming message.

#### **Customize Your Intro and Thank You Sections**

Even though an Intro isn’t necessary, it’s recommended. The CTR of lead ads directly depends on ad copy. You shouldn’t neglect the opportunity to welcome your audience.  

Write a catchy headline to focus your customers’ attention, upload a 1200x628 px image to make your ad more appealing, and present your business with a text description.  

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — intro](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-intro.jpg)

The Thank You screen includes:  

- **Headline**: Up to 60 characters
- **Description**
- **Call to action buttons**: Download, View Website, Call Business
- **Button text**: Up to 60 characters
- **Website link**

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — thank you screen](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-thank-you-screen.jpg)

Remember that your Thank You screen should complete the message from your Intro.

#### **Set Up Custom Questions**

You can add up to 15 custom questions to your form.  

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — custom questions](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-custom-questions.jpg)

There are four types of custom questions, each of which may be helpful in different situations.

**Short answers** give full freedom in answering your question.  

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — short answer](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-short-answer.jpg)

Conditional answers are a **set of questions** where each question depends on the previous answer.

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — conditional answer](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-conditional-answer.jpg)

**Appointment scheduling** allows you to set a time and date for meetings with users.

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — appointment scheduling](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-appointment-scheduling.jpg)

**Multiple choice** allows you to offer a few possible answers to your question.

![How to create Facebook lead generation ads — multiple choice](/img/create-facebook-lead-generation-ads-multiple-choice.jpg)

There’s also a **Store Location** option that allows businesses to let customers find their stores on the map.

#### **Take Advantage of Dynamic Ads**

Dynamic Ads are Image, Carousel, and Collection ads generated by Facebook from your product catalog.  

You set them up once and they run automatically — you don’t have to customize every product ad. Just add a product catalog as a container, upload a data feed with your products, create a product set that includes these products, and install a Facebook Pixel on your website.  

You’ll need a template to generate your Dynamic Ads. To run them, pick a Lead Generation ad objective when setting up an ad campaign.  

Note that there are customized [Dynamic Ads](https://softcube.com/facebook-dynamic-product-ads/) for different industries:  

- Automotive (dealerships)
- Automotive (manufacturers)
- Real estate (brokerages)
- Travel advertisers
- CPG advertisers

Facebook Pixel is code that allows you to track conversions and upload [Custom Audiences](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-custom-audiences/).
