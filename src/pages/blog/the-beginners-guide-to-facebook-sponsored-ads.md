The world of Facebook advertising is multifarious. 

To be part of this world and make changes in it, it’s enough to go to Ads Manager, create a new ad campaign, and launch ads.

Here’s how the process looks:

Launched ads are popularly known as [Facebook dark posts](https://softcube.com/guide-to-dark-posts-on-facebook/). This is the main way to make your contribution to the world of Facebook advertising, with benefits for your business.

However, there’s an alternative that takes less time, effort, and experience.

## What is a Facebook Sponsored Ad?

Also called Business Page ads or boosted posts, Facebook sponsored ads are paid publications launched from a [Facebook Business Page](https://softcube.com/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page/) and shown to a targeted audience on different placements in order to get more views, reactions, likes, shares, and comments.

![Facebook sponsored ads — Facebook Page](/img/facebook-sponsored-ads-facebook-page.jpg)

How do sponsored ads on Facebook work? To create a sponsored ad, you don’t need to log in to Ads Manager. Just click **Promote** in the left-hand column on your Page (under the Page menu) and pick a sponsored ad type.

Sponsored ads on Facebook can help you reach the following business goals:

- **Get more website purchases** (as tracked by your Facebook Pixel)
- **Boost a post** from your News Feed
- **Get more leads** by [collecting people’s contact](https://softcube.com/how-to-create-facebook-lead-generation-ads/) info in a customized form
- **Promote your app** and increase app downloads in Google Play or the App Store
- **Promote your Send Message button** to encourage users to contact your business
- **Promote your Page** to boost the number of likes
- **Promote your business locally** to show online users the location of your brick-and-mortar store 
- **Promote your Learn More button** to get people interested in your online business
- **Get more website visitors** and boost your traffic

Additionally, you can **launch automated ads** to let Facebook find the right sponsored ads for the right audience automatically.

## How to Achieve Your Goal with Facebook Sponsored Ads

Want to learn how to run a sponsored ad on Facebook? Read these recommendations.

### Recommendation 1. Create Mobile-First Content 

Most people who are going to see your sponsored ads are smartphone users. 

As a smartphone user yourself, you understand the importance of catching people’s attention within the first seconds (or even less).

According to the [Mobile Marketing Association](https://www.mmaglobal.com/news/mobile-marketing-association-reveal-brands-need-first-second-strategy), it takes less than half a second for mobile users to understand whether they like the ads they see.

Make sure your sponsored ads captivate mobile users as soon as possible.

### Recommendation 2. Maintain High Quality 

Quality has a direct impact on performance. To perform well, all the elements of your sponsored ads should complement each other.

Describe your offer with **text** using a call to action, emoji, and less than 90 characters.

Use **visuals** to demonstrate your offer. Also:

- Don’t add text on images
- Stick to [ad specifications](https://softcube.com/questions-about-facebook-video-ad-specs/)
- Avoid using stock content

Attract attention with a catchy and relevant **headline** based on a call to action that’s different from the call-to-action button below.

### Recommendation 3. Create Different Audiences for Different Sponsored Ads

When you launch your sponsored ad on Facebook, you have several options to find new customers for your business:

- Customize an audience based on age, location, interests, etc.
- Target people who like your Page
- Contact people (and friends of people) who like your Page
- Reach people in your local area

Also, you can create a [Custom Audience](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-custom-audiences/) and use Facebook to target current customers. 

You segment your audience into different groups, don’t you?

Custom Audiences is a feature that allows you to upload lists of people who have already interacted with your business and target these people based on different marketing objectives.

For your sponsored ads, you should create as many target audiences as possible to learn which targeting methods can bring more profit to your business.

### Recommendation 4. Don’t Spend Too Much in the Beginning

Many people wonder about Facebook sponsored ads cost. Thankfully, you can keep it under control, as you never spend more than you allocate when it comes to Facebook advertising.

Just remember not to waste your budget and start with the minimum amount you can spend to be sure your ads show good results. If they don’t, then don’t hurry to spend more. Instead, try to change the duration or pick another sponsored ad type. 

### Recommendation 5. Always Rely on Testing

Did you know that sponsored ads are much more successful after testing?

Experiment with different headlines, ad copy, visuals, audiences, budgets, and placements to compare strategies and find the ones that work best.

After creating a few A/B tests and learning how to give sponsored ads on Facebook, you’ll be able to repeat ad strategies that were effective and use them for creating successful new sponsored ads.

![Facebook sponsored ads — Test and Learn tool](/img/facebook-sponsored-ads-test-and-learn.jpg)

For testing fully fledged ad campaigns from Ads Manager, take advantage of the [Test and Learn](https://www.facebook.com/test-and-learn/) tool.

### Recommendation 6. Monitor the Performance of Sponsored Ads

Always keep an eye on the performance of your ads once they’re launched. 

Facebook offers [lots of metrics](https://softcube.com/essential-facebook-ad-metrics-you-must-use/) that allows advertisers to measure the impact of their advertising on their audiences and take action if necessary..

If something goes wrong, you’ll be able to turn off your ad or optimize it to get better results.

### Recommendation 7. Get Inspiration from Other Sponsored Ads

You should always be searching for new ideas for your sponsored ads to achieve true success.

If you don’t know how to find sponsored ads on Facebook, you should start by visiting the [Facebook Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/), where you can get inspired by all the Facebook sponsored ads that are currently running.

Just enter the name of any Facebook Page and view any paid posts launched by the Page’s managers.

Additionally, we’ve collected more than [30 Facebook video ad examples](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-video-ad-examples-2019/) made by world-famous brands and companies to give you some inspiration. 

### Recommendation 8. Advertise with Video Content

In one survey, more than [87% of advertising professionals](https://softcube.com/70-video-marketing-statistics-for-2020/) claimed they used video as a marketing tool in 2019.

Launching Facebook sponsored video ads has a lot of advantages. Video content allows you to:

- Showcase your offer in action
- Provide more details about the offer than static ads can
- Have a more powerful effect on customers’ buying decisions
