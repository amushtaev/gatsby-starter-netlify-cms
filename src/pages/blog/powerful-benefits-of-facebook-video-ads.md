Wyzowl has created an [infographic](https://www.wyzowl.com/infographic-the-power-of-visual-communication/) that perfectly illustrates this. You’ll barely recall this article in a few days. But a well-designed visual can sneak into your mind and stay there for a long time.

When it comes to online shopping, we see static banner ads everywhere, but our brains barely notice them. That’s why marketers are actively **[attracting new clients using video content](https://softcube.com/)** on various platforms.

Why use video ads on Facebook? According to Forbes, over [500 million users](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2017/09/22/top-10-video-marketing-trends-and-statistics-roundup-2017/) watch video on Facebook every day. This is the first significant advantage of showing your videos ads there.

## What Are The Benefits of Facebook Video Ads?

There are five main benefits of video advertising on Facebook.

### Benefit 1. The Most Attention-Grabbing Ad Format

Compared to [text and images](https://softcube.com/facebook-video-ads-vs-image-ads/), video is a more effective method to catch customers’ attention, especially on Facebook. Video content demonstrates products in motion, emphasizing their features in the form of unique and creative stories.

Here are some numbers for you according to a [report](https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2018/) by Wyzowl:

* 68% of marketers have used video ads on Facebook
* 87% of these marketers consider Facebook video ads to be effective
* 81% of customers have bought a product after watching a brand’s video

One of the greatest advantages of Facebook video ads is that you can display them on extra placements. What are placements?

### Benefit 2. Extra Placements for Online Promotion

The Facebook family consists of four platforms where marketers can spread their messages: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and the Audience Network.

In addition to Facebook, video ads can be run on two other placements: Instagram and Messenger. You can spread your budget among all three of these placements to reach a much bigger audience and consequently increase brand awareness and plenty of other metrics.

### Benefit 3. Facebook Video Ads Increases Your Brand Awareness

Facebook recommends using [video advertisements](https://softcube.com/fifteen-best-product-video-ads/) for two promotional objectives: brand awareness and video views. However, there are other objectives you can also chase with video advertisement:

* **Reach.** Display your ad to the largest possible audience.
* **Traffic.** Lead people to your website or app.
* **Messages.** Start conversations with leads in Messenger.
* **Conversion.** Get users to take a certain action on your website.
* **Engagement.** Get users to engage with your video ad posts.
* **Store visits.** Create video ads for multiple local stores.
* **App installs.** Increase your app downloads.
* **Lead generation.** Build interest in your business.

As of March 2018, brand awareness was the cheapest objective of Facebook ad campaigns worldwide. Based on average cost per mille (CPM), or the cost per thousand impressions, [this diagram](https://www.statista.com/statistics/829439/cpm-facebook-advertising-campaigns-by-objective/) shows the cost of each objective:

So if you want Facebook users to recall your brand through video ads, you’ll get a double advantage. You’ll not only reach your target audience but also save money.

### Benefit 4. The Second Largest Audience After Google

Always trust the numbers. Facebook is one of the most popular platforms for running [video ads](https://softcube.com/category/video-ads/). Currently, this social media platform has over 2 billion monthly active users. For this reason, tens of thousands of companies run their advertising campaigns there.
