Video advertising is winning over the hearts of marketers all over the world.

![Facebook video ad examples — video ads revenue](/img/facebook-video-ad-examples-video-ads-revenue.jpg)

As the world’s number one social media network, Facebook is poised to [play a big role](https://softcube.com/powerful-benefits-of-facebook-video-ads/) in this video explosion  

The best Facebook video ads help brands connect with new customers every day.

![Facebook video ad examples — mobile video statistics](/img/facebook-video-ad-examples-mobile-video-stats.jpg)

This is all thanks to the special experience and unique advantages video ads provide.

## What Are The Benefits of Video Ads?

[Video ads](https://softcube.com/powerful-benefits-of-facebook-video-ads/) look like short movies with vivid pictures, melodious soundtracks, thrilling scripts, and special effects. They’re successful because they give full creative freedom to their creators.  

They can show many different products in use simultaneously and allow companies to advertise any possible service in action. They’re perfect to bring any message to your target audience.  

Videos create a personal connection that no other type of ad can.  

For that reason, native video is the most successful way to engage with people on Facebook.

![Facebook video ad examples — video engagement](/img/facebook-video-ad-examples-engagement.jpg)

Images [can’t be ignored](https://softcube.com/facebook-video-ads-vs-image-ads/) today, they’ll take the form of GIFs, and be moving as well.  

Naturally, the sooner you join the video ad trend, the better. Before reviewing examples of the best ads, let’s recall Facebook video ad best practices so you can start as smoothly as possible.

### Capture Attention Instantly

Your Facebook videos have to get users to convert within the **first three seconds**. How can you achieve this? Meet the following requirements:  

* Design for mobile and sound-off viewing
* Add text or subtitles for users who turn off the sound
* Add pleasing audio for users who turn on the sound
* Keep your clips to no longer than 15 seconds
* Include your branding as early as possible
* Write minimum text with a call to action (CTA) for your ad description

One more crucial factor you should take into account is publishing videos at scale.

### Bombard Your Audience at Scale

Say you run an online store and use images to display the items from your product catalog.

You’ll need to show dozens or even hundreds of images on a regular basis. Only in this way will customers notice your active performance, which will result in a good conversion rate.  

Video ad campaigns work the same way. You should post content regularly to achieve the desired effect. The bad news is that videos are hard to produce: you need to shoot, edit, and render footage.  

The good news is that the boom in video marketing has prompted advancements in video production.

Artificial intelligence can produce hundreds of [high-quality product video ads](https://softcube.com/) with subtitles and packshots at short notice and for the cost of image ads.

### Use Your Instagram Account To The Maximum

Among Facebook placements, Instagram is the most popular for visual creatives for a few reasons:  

* **It’s the third largest [Facebook placement](https://softcube.com/how-to-place-ads-on-facebook-ad-placements/) platform**. Instagram has over 1 billion monthly active users.
* **Stories**. People watch more [Stories on Instagram](https://softcube.com/the-complete-guide-to-instagram-stories-ads/) than on any other social media network — and there are over 500 million users every day.
* **Checkout**. Customers can buy a product right on Instagram without leaving the app.
* **Instagram apps**. Instagram offers [four mobile apps](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-ad-tools/) for creating and showcasing attractive content: Boomerang, Hyperlapse, Layout, and IGTV.

Facebook has over 2.3 billion monthly active users, and nearly half of them have an Instagram profile.  

Naturally, Instagram is also perfect for Facebook retargeting. You can successfully take advantage of your Instagram business account to post your Instagram ads right on Facebook as well.  

Despite the effectiveness of Instagram, Facebook still has a few more formats to diversify your video content.

### Enjoy The Variety of Video Ad Formats

Each format is unique and has its own advantages. Testing them all and finding the ones that work best for your business is another key to your success.

## 30 Best Facebook Video Ad Examples to Spark Your Creativity

Here are examples of Facebook video ads that can help you find inspiration in 2019.

### Tide

Everything old is new again.  

The Tide marketing team came up with a brilliant idea. They used a few popular Super Bowl ads to make their own Super Bowl commercial.  

Write a hilarious monologue for David Harbour, pepper it with several cliches, and voilà! You’ve got an awesome ad in an ad.  

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/1_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Tide even mocked a well-known Old Spice ad.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/2_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And a typical Valentine’s Day ad.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/3_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

It’s beautiful indeed. Like a meme in a meme.

### Colgate

Colgate is famous for saving your health:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/4_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

For optimizing our water supply:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/5_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And for optimizing the Tooth Fairy’s budget:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/6_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Facebook video ad examples by Colgate show that the company actively uses special occasions to remind us about a few other important things. For example, that we should love each other:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/7_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Save our planet’s water resources:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/8_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And stay in a good mood all the time:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/9_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Don’t you agree?

### Squarespace

Keanu Reeves hasn’t only reached nirvana, saved the world from [artificial intelligence](https://softcube.com/), and revealed himself as the bounty hunter who shut down an entire criminal syndicate.  

He also likes motorcycles. That’s why he started a motorcycle company and created a website.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/10_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Like anything else, creating a Facebook ad successfully is all about finding your inner self.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/11_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

So what are you waiting for? It’s time to create your own effective ad that converts.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/12_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Make it happen!

### Skittles

Sometimes, displaying an ad isn’t so important as creating hype around it.

![Best Facebook video ad examples — Skittles Marcos](/img/best-facebook-video-ad-examples-skittles-marcos.jpg)

Skittles didn’t spend its entire marketing budget on one person. Instead, by showing their standard process of testing an ad on a target group, they intrigued a Facebook live stream audience.  

Skittles hit where it hurts. Curiosity is in our nature. When someone sees something and becomes excited about it, they want to see what all the excitement is about.  

Here’s what Marcos Menendez has actually seen:

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/13_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The mystery isn’t in what Marcos has seen. We’re wondering whether David Schwimmer was born to become part of the Skittles ad campaign or whether Skittles was invented especially to feature David Schwimmer in this ad.

We’ll never know...

### Mercedes-Benz

One of the best German carmakers has lots of great Facebook video ad examples in their arsenal. In fact, when watching these commercials, you can read between the lines and create an ideal ad recipe for your own business.  

When you think of a new high-quality ad, you should be cool in any circumstances.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/14_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Even if you’re waiting too long for your inspiration.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/15_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

You should always trust your intuition and instincts, which can bring you priceless knowledge.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/16_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And don’t forget that knowledge is light.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/17_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

It can flash on you at any moment with vivid colorful ideas.

### Amazon

We have one more amazing Facebook video ad example for you that was produced for the Super Bowl. It’s from one of Facebook’s major competitors in the advertising market starring Forest Whitaker.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/18_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The Kelly brothers, NASA space program participants, are totally comfortable with new technologies.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/19_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And we love how Harrison Ford already hates that.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/20_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

As the ad description says, Harrison Ford is always up for an adventure. We should follow his example.

### Toyota

How often do you dream? Chasing dreams is very important if you want to achieve something in life. Toyota knows that and suggests you to chase your dream in one of their RAV4s.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/21_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

We bet you'd make your dream a reality in a Toyota Supra.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/22_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

These two Facebook ads prove that you can attract the attention of your audience within seconds.

### Lamborghini

Lamborghini claims that you need passion to chase your dreams and make them come true. Or in fact, you need one passionate dad and one enthusiastic son.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/23_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Unleashed dreams make the present a wonderful place and lead to the bright future where something new awaits us all.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/24_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Your Facebook ads are also dreams that can help people find their purpose.

### PUMA

Would you like to feel like an astronaut? Spacewalk is real. And you don’t have to spend millions of dollars to go to space. All you need is to watch this Puma Facebook video ad.  

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/25_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

But be careful. Puma sneakers may affect your imagination...

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/26_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

...and make you buy an extra pair of sports shoes.

### Xiaomi

If you want to promote your business or brand using Facebook video ads, you don’t necessarily have to show your products. You can use your product and come up with something else  

Something unusual as Xiaomi Terminator Bunny.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/27_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

One more great idea for your Facebook video ad is to show your product or service in action.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="360">
    <source src="/img/28_n.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

For example, Xiaomi tested one of their devices in Antarctica. A trip trailer looks great:
