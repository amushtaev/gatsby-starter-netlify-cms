Every company wants to create dynamic and eye-catching video ads for their products. But videos are effective only when produced at scale. So businesses face a big challenge with modern video marketing: making a lot of video ads takes a lot of time and money.

With this in mind, we developed an **[AI-powered video creation platform](https://softcube.com)** that allows any company to overcome this challenge for Facebook ads. Softcube has successfully launched thousands of top-notch product video ads for businesses that run ad campaigns on the world’s top social network.

Today, we’re happy to announce that our clients can benefit from video marketing using Softcube for Google Ads.

## Softcube for Google Ads Now Available

Google Ads is an advertising platform that allows business owners, marketers, and advertisers to show their ads within the Google Display Network. According to Google, this network reaches 90% of internet users worldwide.

The Google Display Network comprises millions of websites, including Google search results, Google Play, Google Partner websites, and results on Google Shopping, Google Maps, YouTube, and other Google websites.

If you already use or plan to use Google Ads, we have good news for you. From now on, you can meet your advertising goals by running AI-generated ads in your Google Ads Display campaigns.

To get started, you’ll need to provide access to your Google Ads account. Then our specialists will:

1. Log in to your [Google Ads account](https://accounts.google.com/).
2. Create an ad campaign using the Google Ads application programming interface (API). We use the API because our developers make changes to the code as appropriate when setting thousands of ads. Without the API, this is impossible.
3. Add AI-generated video ads to an ad campaign as third-party tags. Each tag consists of the URL of a video and a piece of code. The browser gets a video banner from the URL, while the fragment of code describes how the browser should show it.

As for creating video ads, the Softcube neural network does all the complicated work by searching for product videos on YouTube, cutting the best scenes from them, adding packshots, and rendering the footage.

## Why Use Softcube for Google Ads?

Video production is a collaborative process. To make a professional video for your ad, you have to hire a stage manager, a camera operator, and an audio specialist. And it will take a couple of days for them to shoot, edit, and render one video. It will take a similar amount of time if you record a video on your smartphone and do it all yourself.

In the case of Google Ads, you’ll need to repeat this process dozens or even hundreds of times to achieve your advertising objective.

The Softcube neural network can make 1,000 product videos per week, without any professionals, for the cost of image ads. You’re welcome to test out [our platform](http://softcube.com) for your Google Ads campaign right now.
