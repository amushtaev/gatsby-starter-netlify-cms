Unfortunately, it's happened...

As usual, you were monitoring a couple of ad campaigns you launched in Ads Manager. Everything was fine. But one day, you found that your Facebook ad account was disabled.

Keep your head up! In this tutorial, you’ll find out why Facebook may suspend your ads and show you how to activate a disabled Facebook ad account as fast as possible.

Let's begin.

## Why Was My Facebook Ad Account Disabled?

After you launch an ad, Facebook considers two things.

The first is the ad itself, including its contents, targeting settings, and positioning. The second is the landing page where the ad is displayed, the page’s functionality, and how well the page matches the promoted product or service.

Along with that, Facebook ads must comply with numerous advertising policies and community standards.

### Overview Facebook Advertising Policies

If you haven’t read the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/">Facebook advertising policies</a> before you found your Facebook Ads Manager account disabled, we recommend you do so in order to avoid possible mistakes in the future. If you’ve already read Facebook’s advertising policies, it makes sense to go through them once again, as you may be violating one of them.

### Check Facebook Community Standards

The same goes for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/">Facebook Community Standards</a>, where Facebook describes what’s allowed and what isn’t when advertising. Another reason for disabling your Facebook ad account may be users’ reports about your Business Page, ads, or any other type of content you’ve ever posted.

## How to Restore a Disabled Facebook Advertising Account

If you want to find a&nbsp; solution to a disabled Facebook ad account that will help you get back on track, there’s only one place to look: the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help">Facebook Business Help Center</a>, where you can read about every aspect of creating and managing your ad accounts and ads.

To save your time, we’ve found possible ways of making an appeal. When Facebook disables your Facebook ad account, your appeal can take two forms:

### Solution 1. Live Chat with a Facebook Representative

In terms of how to appeal your Facebook ad account being disabled, the best way is to communicate with a human specialist.

### Solution 2. Fill Out Two Forms

Alternatively, you can use two forms to reactivate a disabled Facebook account.

![Facebook ad account disabled — request review form](/img/facebook-ad-account-disabled-request-review-form-1024x453.png)

If you think your ad account was disabled because you violated a policy or standard, request an ad account review by filling out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/2026068680760273">this form</a>.

![Facebook ad account disabled — payments form](/img/facebook-ad-account-disabled-payments-form.png)

If you think your ad account was disabled by mistake, provide Facebook with detailed information by filling out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/391647094929792">this form</a>.

After you send your request, keep regularly checking the Facebook Help Center. Your disabled ad account may be reviewed at any time. Once it’s been reviewed, you’ll receive a response to your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help">Help Center</a> support inbox.
