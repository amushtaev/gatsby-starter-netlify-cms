Have you received a message from a family member, friend, colleague, or business today? I bet this message was sent via one of Facebook’s apps or services.

![Messenger ads — Facebook dominance](/img/messenger-ads-facebook-dominance.jpg)

According to Statista, more than [2.8 billion users](https://www.statista.com/chart/2183/facebooks-mobile-users/) take advantage of at least one Facebook platform, among which Messenger is the most beloved.

Over [40 million companies](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/5-reasons-messaging-is-taking-flight-with-travelers) around the world use Messenger to promote their products and services to customers and to be in touch with them 24/7.

## The Beginner’s Guide to Messenger Ads

Launched in 2011, Messenger is now the number two messaging app in the world after WhatsApp. Its user base is equal to the population of India. 

Pretty soon, the number of Messenger users is likely to approach the population of China.

![Messenger ads — the number of  active Facebook users](/img/messenger-ads-facebook-users.jpg)

As of October 2019, there were over [1.3 billion people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/) using Messenger every month. Just imagine how many Pusheen cat stickers people send each other every day!

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://giphy.com/embed/czhp123dcmKFG" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Actually, let’s imagine you’re about to get started with Facebook Messenger advertising. How should you go about it?

First, you need a [Facebook Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/) account.

This is where you’ll do everything related to your ad campaign: pick a marketing objective, target an audience, manage your budget, customize and schedule ads, set tracking, etc.

![Messenger ads — Messages objective in Ads Manager](/img/messenger-ads-ads-manager.jpg)

Say you log in to Ads Manager and you’re ready to launch your first Messenger ad campaign. You’ll notice the **Messages** objective, and you’ll probably want to select it.

![Messenger ads destination](/img/messenger-ads-destination.jpg)

The messages marketing objective is designed to generate leads, boost sales, and enhance the customer experience by sending a message to one of three destinations: Messenger, WhatsApp Business, or Instagram Direct.

If you’re serious about advertising your business via messaging, you should definitely test this option. However, keep in mind that it’s not the only way to launch your Messenger ads.

## 4 Messenger Ad Formats to Begin an Engaging Conversation

Customers and companies receive more than [20 billion messages](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/why-messaging-businesses-is-the-new-normal) via Messenger each month.

Businesses across 15 markets consider the effectiveness of messaging as “excellent” or “very good” compared to phone calls.

And the cool thing about messaging is that it can take many different forms.

Here are four types of ads you can launch on Messenger:

### 1. Ads in the Messenger Inbox

Ads in the Messenger Inbox will encourage people from your target audience to start a conversation with your business by appearing in the Chats tab of the Messenger app. 

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" title="" style="max-width:360px; max-height:481px; width:100%; height:480px; min-height: 480px;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/MbAUFfYbEg95QIaeNL" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

Another huge benefit you get with this Messenger ad format is that it can help you be in the limelight for a large number of people so they’ll keep your business in mind.

After users stumble on an ad in their inbox and tap on it, they’re directed to a detailed view that has a call-to-action button. After they tap on this CTA, they’re directed to any destination you set: a Messenger chat, mobile app, or website.

**Best Practices for Ads in Messenger Inbox:**

* Preview both the inbox and detailed views before publishing your ad to make sure it looks great.
* Create close-up images with high contrast, a clear focal point, and minimum text overlay to make them noticeable to viewers.
* Make sure your image has a 1:1 ratio so it appears right in the center. Images with other ratios will automatically be masked to 1:1 to show up in the center.
* Start your ad copy with a call to action and keep your message short and clear.

### 2. Messenger Stories Ads

Having first appeared on Instagram and Facebook, [Stories ads](https://softcube.com/the-complete-guide-to-instagram-stories-ads/) are now also available on Messenger.

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" title="" style="max-width:360px; max-height:481px; width:100%; height:480px; min-height: 480px;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/QBWzHQmf0XQ32PnnCz" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

Powered by [Instant Experience](https://softcube.com/how-to-get-started-with-facebook-instant-experience/), Messenger Stories ads allow you to spark users’ interest with an appealing, dynamic, and captivating visual narrative about your company, products, and services.

After people tap on a call-to-action button on your Story ad, they’re driven to a chat with your business.

**Best Practices for Messenger Stories Ads:**

* Keep the length of your story ads from 4 to 7 seconds. It’s a golden middle that gets viewers interested without being intrusive.
* Come up with a story that will encourage people to start a conversation with you. In other words, create intrigue. 

### 3. Click to Messenger Ads

Facebook reports that click to Messenger ads is one of the [fastest-growing ad formats](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/5-reasons-messaging-is-taking-flight-with-travelers). This format allows you to hook the attention of customers on Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook and then chat with them one-on-one after they tap the ad.

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" title="" style="max-width:360px; max-height:481px; width:100%; height:480px; min-height: 480px;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/XGVemHE9kNl58efqVm" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

**Best Practices for Messenger Stories Ads:**

* Write a personalized welcome message to introduce your business.
* Add quick replies to simplify the process of acquaintance.
* Use the messages marketing objective to show ads to users who are more likely to engage with your company.

### 4. Messenger Sponsored Ads

Using sponsored Messenger ads is one of the best Messenger retargeting techniques. With this advertising format, you can contact Messenger users you’ve already engaged with by sending highly personalized offers they’re likely to be interested in.

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" title="" style="max-width:360px; max-height:481px; width:100%; height:480px; min-height: 480px;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/d8VewvkMFMrXsi5ZwJ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

**Best Practices for Messenger Sponsored Ads:**

* Strike while the iron is hot. Ideally, you should show your retargeting ad within two days of the first contact.
* Be ready to respond at any moment after launching your Messenger sponsored ad campaign. Customers may have questions about your offer. Don’t miss this great opportunity.
