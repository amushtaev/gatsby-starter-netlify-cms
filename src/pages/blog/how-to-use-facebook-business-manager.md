Facebook is the world’s most popular social media network, with over two billion monthly active users. Its community outnumbers the populations of China and India and keeps increasing rapidly.

As you can see in the image above, the platform’s revenue mainly comes from advertising. This means that Facebook is no longer just a social media platform. Today, it’s also a marketing platform. Here’s why.

## What is Facebook Business Manager?

Facebook Business Manager (FBM) is a free platform that allows users who have several Facebook Pages or ad accounts to work with them in one place.

So how can marketers profit from this platform? We call it *the rule of three M’s*:

* **Manage**. As a business owner, you’re free to invite other people to collaborate and assist.
* **Market. As an advertiser, you can access ad accounts and Pages of your clients to grow their businesses.**
* **Monitor. As an analyst, you can track all statistics and reports using just one platform**

If you’re an experienced advertiser, you’re familiar with these three major advertising linchpins. Let’s highlight the benefits of Facebook Business Manager that will make your ads more engaging and ease your workflow.

### Run Ads on Facebook Placements

When creating an ad campaign in FB Business Manager, managers can choose a few more places to run their ads in addition to Facebook.

#### Messenger

According to Statista, [Messenger](https://softcube.com/facebook-audience-network-complete-guide/) has over 2 billion active monthly users. This number is expected to grow to over 2.4 billion by 2021.

#### Instagram

As of June 2018, [Instagram](https://softcube.com/recommendations-for-instagram-sponsored-ads/) had reached 1 billion active users. Instagram accounts for over 27% of Facebook’s net mobile advertising revenue in the US and over 18% worldwide.

#### Audience Network

Audience Network is a network of over 6,000 websites and mobile apps where Facebook can show its ads.

Each placement has its pros and cons depending on audience reach and the types of ads used in a campaign. Facebook Business Manager offers two modes for choosing placements: automatic and manual.

### Reach Customers Using Audience Insights

FBM uses hundreds of algorithms to help companies target customers.

Audience Insights is a tool that allows managers to define, choose, and explore their target audiences on Facebook. Using Audience Insights, you can learn everything about your potential customers and their behavior:

* Age and gender
* Relationship status
* Education level
* Job title
* Location
* Children
* Political views (US only)
* Life events
* Page likes
* Frequency of activities
* Device

To define your target audience, go to the FBM main menu and click **Audience Insights** in the **Plan** category.

### Design Facebook Ads with Creative Hub

Imagine you’re starting a project. You want to (or have to) run your ad campaigns and create your ads by yourself.

Or you have some ideas you’d like to bring to life, but you don’t know how to describe them to your designer so it’s best to do everything yourself. Or you’re a professional with lots of concepts and you need to prototype and compare them.

![How to use Facebook Business Manager - Creative Hub](/img/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-creative-hub.jpg "how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-creative-hub")

To help with all of these needs, Facebook developed Creative Hub. This tool allows users to create ad mockups and see how they look on different screens before publishing. You can also share mockups with colleagues and friends to receive feedback. The cool thing is that they don’t need a Facebook or Instagram account to see your work.

Thanks to Creative Hub, both marketing experts and beginners can learn more about Facebook ad formats such as story, collection, 360 video, slideshow, and carousel. For instance, if an advertiser doesn’t know the size and ratio of an image ad type, they can find all media specifications in the View Formats category of the Creative Hub menu.

Marketers can also get inspired by the Creative Hub ad gallery. This gallery includes dozens of awesome [ads published in different formats](https://softcube.com/how-to-select-types-of-facebook-ads/) by other Facebook ad managers.

To create a mockup, go to the main menu of Business Manager and click **Creative Hub** in the **Plan** category.

### Manage Business On The Go with the Ads Manager App

Entrepreneurs are always busy, thinking about their businesses 24/7. They can’t always sit in front of their laptops to monitor their Facebook campaigns. That’s why Facebook developed the Ads Manager app that lets marketers to

* create new ads;
* edit existing ads;
* track ad results;
* edit schedules and ad budgets;
* get push notifications.

## How to Add Facebook Business Pages to Business Manager Account

Having a few pages on Facebook Business Ad Manager is a routine practice. For example, big companies have separate pages for different countries; entrepreneurs create pages for different businesses.

To get started, go to **Business Settings**. Then open the **Accounts** tab, click **Pages**, and press the **+ Add** button in the **Business Settings** menu on the left. Facebook offers three options for adding Pages to your account.

### Add a Page

### Request Access to a Page

This option is for advertisers and marketers. If you [run ad campaigns](https://softcube.com/creating-effective-facebook-ads/) for another company, you can permanently add its Pages without owning them.

### Create a New Page

This option allows a Business Manager user to create a new Page.

<a name="addaccounts"></a>
## How to Add Your Facebook Ad Accounts

To add your Facebook ad accounts, go to **Business Settings**. Open the **Accounts** tab and click **Accounts**.

![How to use Facebook Business Manager - pages](/img/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-pages.jpg "how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-pages")

Facebook allows managers to add up to five ad accounts. As a manager, you can add more than one account only when you start running ads on the first one.

There are three ways you can add a Facebook Business Manager account.

### Add an Ad Account

Note that you can’t add an account created by another manager. Before adding an account, make sure you’re the owner and an admin of this account.

There are three cases when you may not be able to add an account:

1. Someone else has already added this Page to Business Manager.
2. The account is your personal page that you’ve already added.
3. You already have five ad accounts.

If you work on an account that doesn’t belong to you, use the second option below.

### Request Access to an Ad Account

Do you help other companies to launch their campaigns? Add accounts that don’t belong to you by requesting access.

### Create a New Ad Account

Create an account in Business Manager from scratch. Note that you can transfer this account to other users only if they have Business Manager profiles.

## How to Delete Facebook Business Manager Account

If you wish to delete your FBM account, keep in mind three things.

1. You must be an admin.
2. Not all accounts can be deleted.
3. You can deactivate your profile instead of deleting it.

To delete your FBM, go to **Business Settings** and open the **Business Info** tab. On the right side, you’ll see a button that says **Permanently Delete Business**. That’s it. The system will delete your profile in 24 hours.

![How to use Facebook Business Manager - deletion](/img/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-deletion.jpg "how-to-use-facebook-business-manager-deletion")

Note that you’ll erase all the content you’ve ever produced, shared, and used, including catalogs, event source groups, asset libraries, and projects. You’ll also lose access and permissions to all Pages, ad accounts, and Pixels.

However, Facebook won’t let you delete Business Manager for Facebook ads until you do a few things.

### How to Prepare Your FBM Profile for deleting

According to Facebook’s policy, you have to prepare your account for removal. Be sure you have no ad account charges outstanding. If you’ve connected too many Pages, ad accounts, and people, you should delete them. The same goes for all the apps you’ve added to your profile.

### How to Deactivate a Business Manager Account

If you need a break, Facebook can let you pause your project by deactivating your ad account. To do this, go to **Business Settings**, open the **Accounts** tab, and click **Ad Accounts**. Find the account you would like to deactivate in the list and click the **Deactivate** button.

Remember that you can create a limited number of accounts. By deactivating one of your accounts, you make room for a new account.
