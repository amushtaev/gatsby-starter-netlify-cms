When it comes to advertising a business online, Facebook is one of the first platforms that comes to mind. According to an official Facebook report, [7 million businesses](https://www.statista.com/statistics/778191/active-facebook-advertisers/) launched ad campaigns on Facebook in 2017.

In the first quarter of 2020, the social media platform helped [8 million advertisers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/778191/active-facebook-advertisers/) promote their products and services by targeting any audience they wanted to reach.

But the Facebook special ad category has changed how you can target users for certain types of ads.

## What’s So Special About Facebook Special Ad Category?

The Special ad category on Facebook is aimed at preventing advertising discrimination against target audiences in the areas of employment, credit, and housing.

In other words, if you plan to run employment, credit, or housing ads, you’ll need to pick the appropriate special ad category along with a campaign objective.

After you choose your Facebook special ad category and proceed to creating an audience for your ad campaign in Ads Manager, you’ll face the following limitations:

- **Locations**. ZIP code selection is unavailable. You must include areas within a 15-mile radius of any selected location.
- **Age**. This option is fixed to everyone 18 years and older.
- **Gender**. You’ll have to show your ads to users of all genders.
- **Detailed targeting**. Demographics and behaviors are unavailable. You can target people only based on their interests.

Keep in mind that audience sources such as Custom Audiences, Lookalike Audiences, and Saved Audiences have undergone some changes as well.

Facebook Custom Audiences must comply with [Facebook’s policy on Discriminatory practices](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/discriminatory_practices).

When your ad campaign falls within a special ad category, Facebook Lookalike Audiences will be called Facebook Special Ad Audiences. 

A Special Ad Audience on Facebook includes people who look like users from Custom Audiences. However, it excludes characteristics that may discriminate against users you target.

If you want to use Saved Audiences that you’ve already created for standard ad campaigns, Facebook will only apply settings that comply with special ad categories requirements.
