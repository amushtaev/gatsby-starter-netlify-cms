Social media is changing the way we communicate with each other. 

Along with creating posts about their personal lives, people love commenting on, liking, and sharing content produced by their friends, family, and businesses. And clearly, Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms for doing this.

![Promote a Facebook Page — the number of businesses](/img/promote-a-facebook-page-number-of-advertisers-1024x576.jpg)

Over [140 million businesses](https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go/140m-more-than-140-million-businesses-use-facebook-products-every-month-to-find-new-customers-hire-employees-or-engage-with-their-communities/) use Facebook products every month to find new customers, hire employees, and engage with their communities.

Of course, your business may not take advantage of all Facebook products. However, Facebook fan Page promotion has become a marketing standard.

It works for everyone from big players like [Coca-Cola and Louis Vuitton](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-pages-you-should-follow/) to local companies that make your favorite craft beer or handmade accessories.

## How to Promote a Facebook Page Like a Pro Marketer

Let’s start with recommendations from [Sandi Krakowski](https://www.facebook.com/SandiKrakowskiBiz), an influencer and angel investor who has used Facebook since 2012 to build a $20 million business.

![Promote a Facebook Page — Sandi Krakowski](/img/promote-a-facebook-page-sandi-krakowski.jpg)

Right now, Sandi has nearly a million and a half fans on Facebook. When she started to promote a Facebook Page, she used it only as a way to talk about her products. Then she changed her thinking to make her Facebook marketing more personal and diverse.

In [a post](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebook-page-tips-sandi-krakowski) on Facebook for Business, she shares the following advice for succeeding at Facebook marketing:

- Research other Pages and adopt practices of other businesses.
- Learn new things about Facebook marketing on a regular basis using Facebook help resources.
- Come up with a detailed About section for your Facebook Page using keywords, and add your phone number and your website address.
- Use your face as the face of your business by adding your photo as an image cover for your Page.
- Have loving relationships with your customers and know your marketing goals.

Here are four additional Facebook Page promotion tips that will help you make your marketing more comprehensive:

### Feed Your Audience with Information and Entertainment

The Facebook News Feed works using an algorithm based on Facebook Community Standards. These standards are aimed at making your Page more friendly to visitors. To attract more visitors to your Page, your Feed should provide your community with two things.

The first thing is information. Over time, Facebook has discovered that people appreciate publications they consider relevant and informative. That’s why your major value should be posting news and updates related to your business and industry that make viewers take some useful action.

The second thing is entertainment. In the world of advertising, humor plays a crucial part. Along with providing valuable information, make your customers feel good and positive and you’re definitely going to see a great boost in conversions.

### Integrate Messenger into Your Page and Maintain Contact

Think for a moment. What is Facebook Page promotion?   
In a substantial way, when you promote a Facebook Page, you maintain contact with your audience — or even more, you strengthen it.

![Promote a Facebook Page — most popular Facebook activities](/img/promote-a-facebook-page-facebook-activities.jpg)

According to an [online survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/275788/share-of-facebook-user-activities/) conducted by eMarketer and Bizrate Insights, more than 50% of people surveyed in the United States say their most popular Facebook activity is sending a message on Facebook Messenger.

If you want to know how to promote a Facebook Page, use Facebook and Messenger together. Once you integrate Messenger functionality into your Page, you’ll be able to respond to inquiries of Facebook users, answer their questions, solve their problems, and do what a caring business always does — provide customers with great customer service, thus boosting your conversions and sales.

### Test Paid Advertising to Support an Organic Boost

When boosting your Page, you may face a dilemma: Should you pay for Facebook boosted posts or promote the Page itself? Test both options to find out which works best for you.

![Promote a Facebook Page — an ad](/img/promote-a-facebook-page-ad.jpg)

In fact, many companies prefer to save their budget and launch targeted ads instead of spending money on promoting their Pages. In this way, they kill two birds with one stone. 

After users tap on a Facebook ad that makes them convert into customers, there’s a big chance they’ll like your Page and become active there. Not to mention that the Facebook Page promotion cost may eventually be higher than the cost of traditional targeted ad campaigns.

If you have the intention to promote your Page with Facebook ads, you can do that right through your Page or by means of Ads Manager. But be careful.

Thanks to the rich variety of [Facebook ad formats](https://softcube.com/facebook-ad-formats-you-need-to-know/) and targeting options available in Ads Manager, you don't have to advertise your Page directly but can choose any other marketing objective that fits your current strategy.

### Post a Lot of Mobile Video

Video is a very popular type of content on Facebook.

The [same survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/275788/share-of-facebook-user-activities/) we mentioned above by eMarketer and Bizrate reveals that 37% of US Facebook users visit the platform to watch a Feed video, and 23% come to watch a video on Facebook Watch.

To promote a Facebook Page, you should post a lot of diverse video content all the time. And remember to make your videos with mobile in mind, as [75% of worldwide video](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/how-to-maximize-the-impact-of-mobile-video) is viewed on mobile devices according to eMarketer.

If you have products or services that you want to boost with video, save your ad budget with the [Softcube artificial intelligence platform](http://softcube.com). It will help you make high-quality video content at scale and for the cost of image ads.
