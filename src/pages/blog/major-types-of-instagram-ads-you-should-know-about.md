Who would have guessed that a photo sharing mobile app would become one of the world’s largest advertising platforms? Facebook, of course!

![Types of Instagram ads — Instagram acquisition](/img/types-of-instagram-ads-instagram-acquisition.jpg)

Since being acquired by Facebook in April 2012, Instagram has grown its audience from 30 million to more than 1 billion. Now you’re looking for the most appropriate types of Instagram ads to grow your business.

## What Types of Instagram Ads Are There?

There are three ways a business or brand can advertise products and services on Instagram.

The first way is with organic advertising — creating and showing Instagram posts without spending money.

The second way is with influencer marketing — paying Instagram influencers to collaborate with you and mention your business or brand in Instagram posts.

The third way is with sponsored advertising — boosting your Instagram posts for money or running targeted ad campaigns on Instagram with multiple ads at the same time.

Let’s take a closer look at all the types of Instagram ads for 2021 so you can understand which way your business can move on Instagram.

## Type 1. Organic Advertising

Every business or brand starts marketing on Instagram with the goal of growing their audience. The only way to get more followers for your Instagram profile as well as to learn the habits and preferences of your target audience is by regularly creating captivating posts.

![Types of Instagram ads — the number of daily posts](/img/types-of-instagram-ads-number-of-daily-posts.jpg)

In 2019, the seven most active industries in terms of publishing branded Instagram posts were:

* Sport teams — 1.76 daily posts on average
* Fashion — 0.96 daily posts on average
* Health & beauty — 0.94 daily posts on average
* Media — 0.87 daily posts on average
* Retail — 0.82 daily posts on average
* Home decor — 0.72 daily posts on average
* Hotels & resorts — 0.63 daily posts on average

To convert a viewer into a buyer, an Instagram branded post should be relevant and visually appealing, have simple and short copy, and inspire action.

## Type 2. Influencer Advertising

Advertising on Instagram can be really lucrative for influencers.

Did you know that Cristiano Ronaldo earns more from advertising brands on Instagram than from playing soccer? According to [Goal.com and Buzz Lingo](https://www.statista.com/chart/19728/cristiano-ronaldo-makes-more-from-instagram-than-soccer/), Ronaldo earned $47.8 million on Instagram in 2019, while his annual salary with Juventus was around $34 million.

[Research by Buzz Bingo](https://www.statista.com/chart/19795/annual-average-income-from-instagram/) shows that the top ten Instagram influencers — Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Kendall Jenner, David Beckham, Selena Gomez, Neymar Jr, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Kylie Jenner, Ronaldinho, and Khloé Kardashian — bring in a combined total of more than $124 million from Instagram activities.

But how effective is influencer marketing on Instagram for brands and businesses?

![Types of Instagram ads — influencer marketing](/img/types-of-instagram-ads-influencer-marketing.jpg)

According to a [survey by MediaKix](https://www.statista.com/chart/19551/instagram-for-influencer-marketing/) of professional marketers who use influencer marketing, three types of ads on Instagram are among the top four most effective ad formats:

* **Instagram post** — 78%
* **Instagram Story** — 73%
* **YouTube video** — 56%
* **Instagram video** — 54%

eMarketer reports there are [more than 500,000 influencers](https://www.emarketer.com/content/is-everyone-on-instagram-an-influencer) on Instagram. At a time when anyone can be an influencer, you can find and afford one or a few influencers whose audiences would like to know more about your business or brand.

## Type 3. Sponsored Advertising

The simplest way to create a sponsored ad is using the Instagram mobile app.

The more effective way to create a sponsored ad is running an ad campaign in [Facebook Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/), where you can manage campaign objectives, set targeting, and measure ad performance.

When it comes to sponsored advertising, there are six different types of Instagram ads. They’re also called ad formats.

### Instagram Photo Ads

Almost [30% of marketing professionals](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102756/effective-instagram-ad-formats-world/) consider photo ads more effective for attracting customers than other types of ads on Instagram.

### Instagram Stories Ads

According to Visual Capitalist, people post more than [347,000 Instagram Stories](https://www.statista.com/chart/17518/data-created-in-an-internet-minute/) every minute.

### Instagram Carousel Ads

A [Carousel ad](https://softcube.com/how-to-show-carousel-ads-on-facebook/) is so named because it contains up to ten image or video cards with links in a merry-go-round format. With Carousel ads, you can highlight the features of one product or service in a sequential story, or you can demonstrate a few products or services in a single ad.

### Instagram Collection Ads

This multipurpose ad type for e-commerce offers a few ready-made templates that will transform a standard Instagram ad into an online catalog, storefront, brochure, or landing page.
