Facebook advertising tools are used by millions of businesses all over the world.

![Best Facebook ad tools — number of Pages](/img/best-facebook-ad-tools-number-of-pages.jpg)

To interact with their customers, businesses use different approaches while working with pretty much the same tool sets.

## Facebook Ads Software: Official vs. Third-Party

There are lots of third-party Facebook ad tools and platforms to create, optimize, and analyze campaigns. Most of them simplified all these processes.  

Using third-party software can distract you from understanding the fundamentals of [Facebook Business Manager](https://softcube.com/how-to-use-facebook-business-manager/), which is the linchpin of Facebook marketing.  

We’re not encouraging you to avoid third-party instruments. On the contrary, if you find their features useful for achieving your business goals, go ahead and use them!

To become a real guru, you should learn the platform’s every feature.  

The truth is that some advertisers don’t even know about the existence of other official Facebook applications and platforms. We’ll try to fill that gap with this article.

## 15 Facebook Advertising Tools You Might Not Have Heard Of

Ads Manager offers an abundance of opportunities.  

However, many of these advantages aren’t available unless you’re a programmer.  

If you’re a digital handyperson who’s good at more than making Facebook ads, go ahead and create your own tools, apps, and services with [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/).

![Best Facebook ad tools — Ad Library](/img/best-facebook-ad-tools-ad-library.jpg)

To provide full advertising transparency, Mark Zuckerberg’s team has developed [this online database](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/) to show information about all ads launched by all advertisers on Facebook.  

The archive's original aim was to highlight the origins of ads launched by politicians and national issue campaigns.  

If you’re interested in how much such organizations spend on their advertisements, you’re welcome to visit [Ad Library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/report/) and check their total and weekly spending on the website or download the full report in .csv format.

If a company run a few Pages for different countries, you can see ads for any Page.  

### Tool 12, 13, 14, 15. Instagram Mobile Apps

People are obsessed with making Stories and posting photos online that portray their everyday lives. Sometimes, too much so.

![i made this for this](/img/tumblr_muscssmAdD1rt28efo1_500.gif)

This makes Instagram one of today’s most popular digital marketing channels. Also, it’s one of the best Facebook marketing tools that allows agencies and businesses to attract customers that are distinct from their Facebook audiences.  

Aside from the original Instagram mobile app, there are also a few extra mobile apps you can use to make your video content more appealing and promote your business more effectively.  

#### Boomerang

#### Hyperlapse

- [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917)

#### Layout

- [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/layout-from-instagram/id967351793)

- [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/igtv/id1394351700)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.igtv)
