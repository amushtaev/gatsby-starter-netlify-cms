## 7 Lifehacks to Have a Good Start with Facebook Ads Manager

Here are some lifehacks to learn how to get to Ads Manager on Facebook like a pro.

### Lifehack 1. Use the Right Facebook Ad Metrics

The success of your Facebook marketing depends a lot on how you measure your results.

Before launching the first Facebook ad campaign for your business, you should find out how to measure your campaigns. This will give you a significant advantage in the future.

![Facebook ads manager — ad metrics](/img/facebook-ads-manager-ad-metrics.jpg)

Make sure you learn [Facebook ad metrics](https://softcube.com/essential-facebook-ad-metrics-you-must-use/), understand how they work, and know what metrics you need to improve the effectiveness of your ads.

### Lifehack 2. Set Up Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Helper

Along with metrics, there’s one more thing you need to check how well your ads perform.

Facebook pixel is an instrument that allows you to see what actions Facebook users make on your website after they click on your ads.

For example, do they click on a conversion button or add a product to the shopping cart?

Monitoring the behavior of your website audience with Facebook pixel gives several benefits:

- You’ll know whether you’re targeting the right users with the right ads.
- You’ll drive sales and boost conversions on your website.
- You’ll get a better understanding of what people do after they see your ads.

To set up Facebook pixel, you need to do two things.

![Facebook ad manager — Facebook pixel](/img/facebook-ads-manager-pixel.jpg)

The first is to add the pixel base code to your website.

The second is to set up your pixel in [Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager/). Keep in mind that there’s no Facebook Pixel tab in Ads Manager.

Beginners often try to find it there. Once you’re in Events Manager, find the Pixel tab and click the **Create a Pixel** button to create your pixel.

![Facebook ads manager — Facebook Pixel Helper](/img/facebook-ads-manager-pixel-helper.jpg)

Additionally, you can install the [Facebook Pixel Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc?h1=en) to get real-time notifications about the implementation of your Facebook pixels.

One more advantage of Facebook pixel is the ability to grow your sales by launching [Facebook Dynamic Ads](https://softcube.com/facebook-dynamic-product-ads/) that are generated automatically.

### Lifehack 3. Target Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences

The ability to use Dynamic Ads isn’t the only feature that becomes available thanks to Facebook pixel.

After you set up Facebook pixel, you’ll be able to create [Custom Audiences](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-custom-audiences/) that allow you to track down your current customers on Facebook and target them with your ads.

You can form Custom Audiences from the following sources:

- **Website**. Based on your Facebook pixel, you can create a list of your website visitors.
- **Mobile app**. Based on the [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads), you can target people who have installed your mobile app.
- **Customer list**. You can upload a CSV or TXT file with users’ contact information and Facebook will match this data with profiles. 
- **Facebook**. The Engagement Custom Audiences targeting option allows you to show ads to Facebook users who have watched your videos, filled out a [Lead ad form](https://softcube.com/how-to-create-facebook-lead-generation-ads/), clicked on your [Collection ads](https://softcube.com/guide-to-facebook-collection-ads/) powered by Instant Experience, or engaged with Event ads and your Instagram Business profile.

Additionally, you can create Lookalike Audiences, which are lists of Facebook users who are similar to people from your Custom Audiences.

### Lifehack 4. Link Your Facebook and Instagram Accounts

Instagram is one of the world’s top social media websites, visited by more than 1 billion people every month. As of October 2019, nearly [90% of Instagram users](https://business.instagram.com/) followed a business on the platform.

Instagram is also the second most important placement in the Facebook family of apps and services. That’s why you should create Instagram ads in Facebook Ads Manager to get the most from this advertising platform.

![Facebook ads manager — Instagram placements ](/img/facebook-ads-manager-instagram-placements.jpg)

To do that, create a new ad campaign, find the Placements section, and pick one of two options:

- **Edit placements**. Choose Instagram as the placement manually and target users across Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and Instagram Explore.
- **Automatic placements**. Let the platform show your ads automatically to maximize their value across all placements, including Instagram.

Additionally, you can link your Instagram Business account with your Facebook Business account to get more management opportunities like adding people and assigning partners.

Here’s how to link Instagram to Facebook Ads Manager (Business Manager, actually) in three simple steps:

1. Go to [Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings/).
2. Click **Instagram Accounts** on the left.
3. Click the **\+ Add** button.

After that, enter your Instagram account username and password and confirm the changes.

### Lifehack 5. Manage Your Facebook Ads Together

You aren’t the only marketer in your company, are you?

Invite your colleagues to help you create and manage your [Facebook ads](https://softcube.com/creating-effective-facebook-ads/) more effectively.

Users in Ads Manager can have one of three roles:

1. **Admins** can make ads, edit ads and payment methods, check reports, and manage access permissions.
2. **Advertisers** can make, edit, and launch ads using the payment method added to the account.
