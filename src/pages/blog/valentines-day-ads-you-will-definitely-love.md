Do you believe in true love?

Almost 1,021 adults were asked this question in the 2019 [Tattoos, Guns & Love](https://www.statista.com/statistics/669037/share-of-americans-who-believe-in-love/) survey. According to the survey results, the world isn’t doomed yet, as 94% of participants said they do believe in true love.

Another engrossing study was conducted in January 2020 by YouGov. When asked if they believed in soulmates, [56% of US adults](https://www.statista.com/chart/20526/soulmates-americans-love/) said they did, 25% answered they didn’t, and 19% found the question difficult to answer. Interestingly, nearly the same percentage was observed in all age groups from 18- to 24-year-olds and up.

In 2018, 1,011 Americans shared their opinions on Valentine’s Day in a survey by Statista, in which 53% of respondents claimed that people don’t need a specific day to show that they love each other and 36% considered Valentine’s Day the day of love.

According to an [online survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/806027/valentines-day-planned-spending-by-relationship-status-in-the-us/) conducted in January 2020, the average planned spending on Valentine’s Day in the United States was $71.

According to the [Annual 2020 Valentine’s Day Spending Survey](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/confident-consumers-and-broader-buying-lead-record-valentines-day) conducted by the National Retail Federation, Americans were anticipated to spend more than ever on Valentine’s Day gifts in 2020 — $196.31 per person on average and $27.4 billion in total.

Unsurprisingly, the top ten Valentine’s Day gifts among male and female consumers in the United States were dinners out, chocolate, greeting cards, gift cards, alcoholic beverages, personalized gifts, home-cooked meals, flowers, and massages.

## 69 Wonderful Valentine’s Day Ads You’ll Fall in Love With

In this blog post, we’re going to show you a wide variety of Valentine’s Day ads by different brands and companies from many industries.

But first, let’s start with Deadpool, probably the most controversial superhero.

Why Deadpool? In fact, we’re not really interested in Deadpool itself but in the movie’s advertising campaign.

Because it was one of the best Valentine’s Day ad campaigns in the [history of advertising](https://softcube.com/the-entire-history-of-advertising/), and it’s what your Valentine’s Day campaign should ideally be like.

![Valentine's Day ads — YouTube comment](/img/valentines-day-ads-youtube-comment.png)

Resulting in $783 million worldwide in box-office sales, the Deadpool marketing campaign was so successful that some YouTube viewers were sad when they realized they wouldn’t see hilarious Deadpool promos anymore (luckily for them, they will during the release of Deadpool 2).

And there were a bunch of promos…

To get viewers interested, Deadpool said lots of controversial things. He called men and women to touch themselves to prevent testicular and breast cancer and wore a pink costume to raise money for the cancer foundation. He blamed Australians for giving us Wolverine and played soccer in a dream with Manchester United.

Finally, he gave advice for the best Valentine’s Day gift...

Some of you may say that this notorious Deadpool Valentine's Day ad produced for YouTube and television wasn’t romantic at all and was too much even for Deadpool.

However, despite all the nonsense, blood, and dark humor, Deadpool is technically a romantic movie about true love that premiered several days before Valentine’s Day.

![Valentine's Day ads — Twitter post](/img/valentines-day-ads-deadpool-twitter-post.jpg)

Yes. They even made a sentimental poster.

To recap, your Valentine’s ads for your brand or business should be like the Deadpool promotional campaign — a bit sentimental and at the same time out of the box. They should have the guts to stand up for your message.

Let’s see how you can do that using the example of multiple Valentine’s Day social media ideas and Valentine’s Day commercials created for television and YouTube.

## 23 Beautiful Instagram Valentine’s Day Ads

When you’re thinking about running Valentine’s Day advertising and are considering using different platforms, Instagram is probably the first platform that comes to mind due to its focus on beauty and vogue.

Before we begin, here are several insights for brands and businesses advertising on Instagram during the Valentine’s Day season.

**Age and Gender**

As of October 2020, Instagram was extremely popular among two age groups — [18- to 24-year-olds and 25- to 34](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/)-year olds — according to a survey published on Statista.

![Valentine's Day ads — distribution of Instagram users](/img/valentines-day-ads-distribution-of-instagram-users.png)

Another interesting fact is that Instagram isn’t dominated by either gender. In every age group, the number of females and males is almost equal.

**Best Days and Times for Posting**

According to [Instagram’s internal data](https://business.instagram.com/blog/valentines-day-insights), the best time to post on Instagram on Valentine’s Day is between 3 pm and 6 pm Pacific time, while the best days for posting in general are Wednesdays and Thursdays. This information was collected from US Instagrammers who used Valentine’s Day-related hashtags during the 28 days prior to January 27, 2017.

**Recommended Hashtags**

Talking of hashtags, you should add a lot of them to each Instagram post and ad so your content can easily be found and shared. Use hashtags that have the closest associations with Valentine’s Day such as #love, #peace, and #blessed.

Now let’s check out Valentine’s Day ad examples made for Instagram.

**[Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBwiTwdynQO/?utm_source=ig_embed)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Adidas](/img/valentines-day-ads-adidas.jpg)

Adidas made a bold move and published this Adidas Valentine's Day ad that boomed on Instagram in 2016 so much that Adidas started shutting down [homophobic comments](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adidas-valentines-day-ad-same-sex-couple_n_56c56250e4b08ffac127b0eb).

This is how an advertiser can tell a love story with only one image.

The ad copy is the last words of the song The End by the Beatles.

“Good artists copy, great artists steal,” Pablo Picasso said.

Amazon created one of the best Valentine’s Day Instagram posts dedicated to the cats of Amazon customers. People love cats. And what do cats love? Cats love boxes.

When you create a Valentine’s Day video for Instagram, make a short story that lasts up to 15 seconds. And try to use cats because they’re the happiest creatures, especially on Valentine’s Day.

If you’re searching for original Valentine’s Day advertising ideas, you can create a story based on real events. We bet you’ve never thought about watching a romantic video advertising two snails snailing around snail-sized sets.

Have no ideas for a Valentine’s Day Instagram post? Simply try to create a perfect match between two items like Sony did in one of their Instagram posts.

The best Valentine’s Day advertising slogans are a couple of words that should reflect your promotional idea visually. In the post above, you can see how Richard Burbridge, who created a lot of [fabulous ads](https://www.artandcommerce.com/artists/photographers/Richard-Burbridge/Advertising) for multiple luxury fashion brands, creatively depicts Dior’s Instagram ad copy: Love should be on everyone’s lips.

When making Valentine ads, don’t forget about traditional methods. For example, Bulgari posted this photo by [Thomas Lohr](https://www.instagram.com/thomaslohrstudio/) and recommends expressing love in every way you can. It can be with physical touch or stylish jewelry. Or both.

**[Mejuri](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jX3Nlnknv/)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Mejuri](/img/valentines-day-ads-mejuri.jpg)

Mejuri made an example of one of the simplest jewelry Valentine’s Day ads by focusing the attention of Instagrammers on the product itself and nothing else.

If highlighting your products or services seems too obvious for you or you can’t find a creative way to do that, go DIY and surprise people on Instagram with something unusual.

For instance, Lacoste created a simple DIY Valentine’s Day gift ad featuring a heart-shaped paper appliqué with the traditional crocodile logo in the center.

Another idea for an Instagram Valentine’s Day video is to tell Instagrammers what love means to you or to ask customers to share their opinion.

That’s what musical artist [Falana](https://www.instagram.com/falanamusic/) did on behalf of fashion brand Andrea Iyamah, established by Dumebi Iyamah. The result of this black-and-white video is heartwarming.

The rose petal background is a cool trick for your Valentine’s Day visual no matter what industry your business or brand is in. Also, pay attention to the hashtags TWIX used for this post.

Just like flower petals, flowers can work pretty well as the background (or the focal point) for your Valentine’s Day publication even when you don’t sell flowers. Ferrero Rocher’s Instagram page for the United Kingdom and Ireland created a post with a red peony as a stand for their confectionery.

If you’re a girl, you can start celebrating on February 13, or Galentine’s Day — an unofficial holiday originating from the 16th episode of the second season of the American comedy TV series Parks and Recreation and since then established in everyday culture.

Every year, Galentine’s Day is a popular trend on social media and one more reason for companies and brands to create amazing Valentine’s Day social media content.

A cozy atmosphere is the first thing loved ones need when they want to find a perfect spot for their Valentine’s Day dinner out. Have a restaurant and want to get it noticed on Instagram? All you need is to show your warmth through the screen!

### [sweetgreen](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jMQkrnnj4/)

![Valentine's Day ads — sweetgreen](/img/valentines-day-ads-sweetgreen.jpg)

Reposting on Instagram isn’t a crime, especially when you want to share love. Don’t be shy to borrow someone’s idea if it fits the vision of your business and will improve your customers’ mood.

Sweetgreen, an American salad restaurant chain, sees love as a huge bunch of greens. Isn’t that sweet?

**[Restaurant Mirazur](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8h7Qo7C-Zr/)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Mirazur](/img/valentines-day-ads-mirazur.jpg)

If you want to call more customers to your café or restaurant, remember that Valentine's Day restaurant ads can look great without food. Mauro Colagreco, the chef of the Mirazur Restaurant, proves that in this example.

**[California Donuts](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jyqZlnQjA/)**

![Valentine's Day ads — California Donuts](/img/valentines-day-ads-california-donuts.jpg)

When you promote food on Valentine’s Day, a romantic dinner is a really nice move. Love is for everyone, but sweets can be exclusive.

![Valentine's Day ads — Sister Pie](/img/valentines-day-ads-sister-pie.jpg)

We’ve already told you that you should create something lovely by yourself if you want to surprise your Instagram followers but lack interesting ideas.

If you’re going to create some Valentine’s Day social media posts, it’s obvious you need to take advantage of the world’s top social network.

Before we show you some lovely and inspiring ideas you can apply to your ad campaign, read a few interesting facts about Facebook and Valentine’s Day.

![Valentine's Day ads — distribution of Facebook ads](/img/valentines-day-ads-distribution-of-facebook-users.png)

While no gender dominates Instagram, slightly more Facebook users are men in [three age groups](https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/): 18 to 24 years old, 25 to 34 years old, and 35 to 44 years old.

![Valentine's Day ads — sources of inspiration](/img/valentines-day-ads-sources-of-inpiration.png)

A survey by Savvy reports that Facebook was the [third most popular source of inspiration](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095937/valentines-day-sources-of-inspiration-united-kingdom/) after supermarkets and Google for Valentine’s Day gifts among people in the United Kingdom in 2020.

According to [Facebook data](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/winning-hearts-on-valentines-day), both men and women use Facebook to speak about date nights, loved ones, and romance. However, men tend to discuss relationship statuses, proposals, and anti-Valentine’s day, while women tend to talk about food, drinks, and gifts.

Now let’s find out how different businesses and brands make their Valentine’s Day ad ideas for Facebook a reality.

![Valentine's Day ads — Greggs](/img/valentines-day-ads-greggs.jpg)

When you create your Valentine’s Day ads, your goal is to sell pure emotions instead of selling your products and services. After people feel your message, they’ll be happy to buy from you and will come with open arms.

Greggs shows how to do that using an absolutely brilliant Valentine's Day ad copy that consists of only four words.

**[Chloé](https://www.facebook.com/chloe.paris.fashion/photos/a.10150145934335123/10163048293780123)**

On Valentine’s Day 2020, Chloé promoted their Alphabet collection.

If you’re in the jewelry industry and if you can offer an alphabet collection, you should do that.

If you can’t do that but still want to make a [creative Facebook ad](https://softcube.com/the-rookie's-guide-to-creative-facebook-ads/), think about your Valentine’s Day ad as a keepsake that people will remember for a long time and offer something you think is relevant.

When you don’t pay much attention, people can become more attentive.

Here’s a great advertisement example for Valentine’s Day that shows how to promote a product without paying much attention to it.

To promote their watch, Ice-Watch decided to use a heart-shaped box that’s bigger than the watch but has the same color.

You’ve already seen the jewelry alphabet by Chloé and a Ferrero Rocher candy at the top of a peony. Now we offer you the same 2-in-1 experience. To celebrate Valentine’s Day with Facebook users, Snickers put their alphabet bars on top of red roses.

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGhirardelli%2Fvideos%2F479546019378129%2F&show_text=true&width=476" width="476" height="591" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></div>

Valentine’s Day and chocolate ads are like human beings and water. They’re inseparable.

When thinking about Valentine’s Day social media content ideas, remember two major advantages of beauty.

The first advantage is that it can take many different forms. The second advantage is that real beauty doesn’t have to be enhanced.

A great idea is to find the best form you have and show it as it is.

**[Dolce & Gabbana](https://www.facebook.com/DolceGabbana/posts/10151455217869977)**

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fvolkswagen%2Fvideos%2F611154166373132%2F&show_text=true&width=476" width="476" height="591" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></div>

If you’re looking for decent Valentine's Day car ads as examples to create something that will surprise your customers, you can use the car’s interior as a starting point.

For most of us, Valentine’s Day refers to something sweet. If you’re reading this post near children, we should warn you that in the video above Volkswagen filled their car with lollipops.

**[Nissan](https://www.facebook.com/nissan/posts/2848748141849958)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Nissan](/img/valentines-day-ads-nissan.jpg)

If you’re feeling like you can’t come up with good copy, you can focus on taking photos. This marvellous photoshoot of a Nissan Figaro is a great example of how pictures can speak for themselves.

**[Fiat](https://www.facebook.com/Fiat/photos/a.506525839386697/2858876210818303)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Fiat](/img/valentines-day-ads-fiat.jpg)

Why is cupid an amateur? Let us explain.

For their social media Valentine’s Day campaign, Fiat, in collaboration with Bcube, parked the famous 500 model on the heart-shaped red carpet in the center of Milan so couples could kiss each other inside the car.

![Valentine's Day ads — Oriflame](/img/valentines-day-ads-oriflame.jpg)

Placing many tiny details around your product is one more key to a successful Valentine’s Day post. More than that, you can promote several products at once.

**[Revlon](https://www.facebook.com/revlon/posts/10158024655057748)**

![Valentine's Day ads — Revlon](/img/valentines-day-ads-revlon.jpg)

Want to post something original? Pay tribute to a masterpiece from any art genre you like.

Rhyming your product with the beginning of the most famous love poem is nice.

Confessing that you can’t rhyme is great.

Using relevant emojis to enhance the power of rhyme is astonishing.

You may want your man to give you flowers on Valentine’s Day, but you don’t want him to smell like a rose. Isaiah Mustafa, who plays the main character in this and other Old Spice commercials, knows that like no one else because he was born two days before Valentine’s Day.

Here’s a powerful message from Hallmark saying that if you’re going through desperate times and you’re feeling that you’re about to give up, you shouldn’t because there’s always someone who loves you.

Originally launched for television in the Netherlands in 2007, this Valentine’s Day commercial for Amstel Beer is an apology video for every woman who has experienced a dating disaster.

Accompanied by the song If You Don’t Know Me By Now by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff and then covered by Simply Red, this TV spot shows why men are not always romantic.

### **PUMA | The Hardchorus**

We bet this is one of the most extraordinary Valentine’s Day ad campaigns you’ve ever seen.

Before each football game, die-hard fans in England and other European countries gather to celebrate the upcoming event, which in this case happened to be on Valentine’s Day.

In several of the commercials you can see above, PUMA advertises themselves by giving men an opportunity to send a love message to their wives and girlfriends explaining why they can’t be near them at that moment.

For the record, this ad campaign received 113 million impressions on social media and over 15 million online views.

### **Nestle Thailand | KitKat Valentine’s Day 2013**

<div class="blog-iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VaYc6hQSc5g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
