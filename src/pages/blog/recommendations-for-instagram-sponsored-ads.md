Let’s get it straight. Instagram has taken root in everything we do and love.

Many online users can’t imagine their lives without making a daily post about their breakfast, checking news about their favorites, and shopping the latest merchandise produced by top brands.

It’s come to the point where Spongebob Squarepants even has an “Instaclam” profile in his own universe:

How often do you take out your phone to check your Instagram Feed in your own universe?

According to Statista, more than [30% of active Instagram users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/421976/frequency-instagram-use/) worldwide access the social network more than once a day.

Actually, it doesn’t matter how many times people open Instagram. What matters is that the number of these people increases every day, making Instagram one of the most popular social media platforms not only for users but for businesses.

Back in 2017, the number of [monthly active advertisers on Instagram doubled](https://business.instagram.com/blog/welcoming-two-million-advertisers) within just six months, from 1 million in March to 2 million in September.

If you’re about to join them but don’t know how to use Instagram sponsored ads, don’t worry. Just read our beginner’s guide.

## What Are Instagram Sponsored Ads?

Instagram sponsored ads are no different from other Instagram ads. They’re simply promoted posts created with one of three methods.

![Instagram sponsored ads — example](/img/instagram-sponsored-ads-example.jpg)

### Method 1. Instagram Account

Make sure you have a professional Instagram account. You won’t be able to run ads from a personal profile.

Here’s how to get a sponsored ad on Instagram in eight steps:

1. Go to your Instagram business profile.
2. Select **Promotions**.
3. Choose **Create Promotion** at the bottom of the screen.
4. Find a post you want to boost.
5. Tap **Next** in the upper-right corner of the screen.
6. If you haven’t linked your Facebook Page to your Instagram account yet, you can do that now, or you can tap **Skip**.
7. Customize your ad settings such as Destination, Audience, Budget, and Duration and tap **Next**.
8. Tap **Create Promotion** once you’re ready to launch your ad.

Now you’ll need to wait a bit for Instagram to approve your ad. Usually, it takes about an hour to review and approve a promotion.

Read more about Facebook’s [ad policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads) in order to launch your ads on the first attempt without any violations. After you launch your Instagram sponsored ad, you can monitor its performance by selecting **Promotions**.

### Method 2. Facebook Page

Keep in mind that you can connect your Instagram account to your Facebook Page and launch ads from there on both Facebook and Instagram.

To add your Facebook Page to your Instagram account, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Instagram account.
2. Choose **Edit Profile**.
3. Tap on **Page** below Public Business information.
4. Select the Page you want from the list of your Pages, or choose the **Create a New Facebook Page** option to create a new Page.
5. Once you’ve picked your Page or created a new one, tap **Done**.

Note that you must be an admin of a Facebook Page to be able to link it to your Instagram account.

### Method 3. Ads Manager 

[Facebook Ads Manager](https://softcube.com/tips-and-tricks-for-facebook-ads-manager/) allows you to take full advantage of Instagram advertising by creating and launching full-scale ad campaigns that you can optimize at any time.

You can also use Facebook Ads Manager for iOS and Android. This great [Facebook tool](https://softcube.com/best-facebook-ad-tools/) will help you monitor your Instagram sponsored ad campaigns and optimize their performance when you aren’t near your laptop or desktop.
