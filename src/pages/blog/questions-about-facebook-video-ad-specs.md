Successful Facebook video marketing requires three things.

The first thing is video ad production skills. You need to be good at creating head-turning video content to sell your products or services to your target audience.

The second thing is knowledge of the little secrets of Facebook video advertising. For instance, did you know that Facebook advises marketers to produce video ads that are 15 seconds long? Or that 80% of viewers watch videos on Facebook with no sound?

The third thing is an understanding of how Facebook ads actually work. You should launch at least a few ad campaigns to get a grasp of which users to target, how much money to spend, which placements to choose, etc.

And of course, you must know Facebook video ad specs.

### Question 3. What length should my Facebook videos be?

Think mobile. Viewers in the United States aged 18 to 34 watch an average of [105 minutes of online video](https://softcube.com/70-video-marketing-statistics-for-2020/) via their smartphones per week. 

When it comes to video ads and any other type of video content, the shorter your videos are, the more effect they’ll have on your audience.

In fact, Facebook stresses that you need to capture viewers’ attention within the first three seconds of your video ad.

One of the advantages of showing short video content on Facebook is looping. All videos that are less than 30 seconds loop continuously for up to 90 seconds.

For example, a 15-second video ad will have nearly six loops. After looping, the thumbnail of your video appears.

Although short video ads are effective in most cases, don’t forget that long video content can also work great for some Facebook Placements.

For example, you can create long promotional videos (up to 240 minutes) for the Facebook Feed, Messenger Home, and Marketplace.

### Question 4. Do my Facebook video ads need thumbnails?

Definitely. There are three ways of adding thumbnails to your Facebook video ads after you upload them to Ads Manager: 

1. Upload your own thumbnails — this is what Facebook recommends, by the way.
2. Use one of the frames from your video ad after you upload it to Ads Manager.
3. Let Facebook generate your video ad thumbnail automatically from the frames of your video.

Keep in mind that you can’t customize a thumbnail for a video that’s linked to from outside Facebook or for a video that’s part of a boosted post.

### Question 5. Should I use a template to create video ads?

Video marketing is truly effective only when videos are produced at large scale.

But creating video at scale requires lots of resources. Video templates are a great tool to make the video production process easier.

1. Promote a Product
