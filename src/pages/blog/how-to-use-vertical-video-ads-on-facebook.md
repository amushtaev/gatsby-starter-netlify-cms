If you’re going to launch vertical video ads on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, or any other popular platform, now is the best time to do so because digital video content is booming. There are two reasons why we’re witnessing this boom.

![Vertical video ads on Facebook - digital population](/img/vertical-video-ads-facebook-digital-population.png)

First of all, the number of mobile devices is growing rapidly. According to one report on Statista, there were more than [4 billion unique mobile internet users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/) worldwide as of July 2020. That’s more than half of the world’s population.

The second reason is the increase in global internet speeds. In August 2020, a research team from University College London worked with Xtera and KDDI Research to reach a data transmission rate of [178 terabits a second](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/aug/ucl-engineers-set-new-world-record-internet-speed), which is enough to download the whole Netflix library in less than a second.

Put another way, people have gotten used to watching a lot of mobile video content these days. The question is, what part does vertical video play in all this?

## The Rise of Vertical Video Content on Major Platforms  

In the beginning of the 2010s, companies didn’t take vertical video marketing seriously. People mocked vertical videos (mostly uploaded to YouTube) so much that the [vertical video syndrome](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vertical-video-syndrome) meme appeared in 2012.

### Step 1. Launch Events Manager

Events Manager is a sub-platform where all Facebook pixel activity happens. From Events Manager, you can monitor how, where, and why your conversions happen.

![Create a Facebook pixel — Events Manager](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-events-manager.jpg)

To launch Events Manager, go to Business Manager, open a dropdown menu, and click the Events Manager icon. Once you’re there, click **Connect Data Sources** to create a new data source.

![Create a Facebook pixel — data sources](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-data-sources.jpg)

### Step 2. Create a New Data Source

There are three major types of data sources available in Events Manager:

1. **Web**. Create a new Facebook pixel to track website conversions.
2. **App**. Install the Facebook SDK to track mobile app conversions.

**Offline**. Use offline data to boost online conversions.

![Create a Facebook pixel  — a new data source](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-new-data-source.jpg)

Since you’re here to learn everything about creating a pixel on Facebook, choose the **Web** option. After that, click **Get Started**.

![Create a Facebook pixel — connection methods](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-connection-method.jpg)

Next, you need to choose **Facebook Pixel** as your connection method and click **Connect**.

![Create a Facebook pixel — details](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-details.jpg)

Then enter a name for your pixel and check your website for easy setup options (if necessary) and click **Continue**.

### Step 3. Add Pixel Code to Your Website

The third step is to connect your website by adding pixel code to all pages.

![Create a Facebook pixel — code set up](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-code-installation.jpg)

You can connect website activity to Facebook using a pixel in two ways.

The first way is by manually adding pixel code to the header of every website page. If you don’t know what this means, you can click **Email Instructions** in the bottom right and ask for the help of tech-savvy professionals.

If you took advantage of a popular user-friendly CMS (like WordPress or WooCommerce) to build your online store, you can find your platform in the list and follow step-by-step instructions to finish the installation.

After you choose your installation method, you need to create events for your pixel.

### Step 4. Set Up Facebook Pixel Events

The next step after adding pixel code is adding pixel events. Pixel events are actions Facebook users need to take to complete conversions on your website.

There are two types of events: standard and custom. 

[Standard events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/reference) include visiting a home page or placing an item in the shopping cart. You can add standard events using the **Event Setup Tool** in the **Settings** of your pixel.

![Create a Facebook Pixel — events](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-events.jpg)

Custom events come in handy when you want to track non-standard actions made by your customers on different pages. You can [add them manually](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) by means of code.

Now that we’ve reviewed how to create a Facebook pixel, let’s answer one of the most popular questions Facebook advertising newcomers have when learning how to create a new Facebook pixel.

## Can I Create a Few Facebook Pixels?

When you create your first pixel, Facebook says you can create _only one pixel per ad account._

![Create a Facebook pixel — one pixel per website](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-one-pixel.jpg)

However, Facebook has an exception for professional advertisers. Say you entrust creating and running your Facebook ads to several agencies and you want to provide each agency with separate access to your marketing activities. In this case, you can create a second Facebook pixel — or third or fourth. All you need to do is edit the code.

![Create a Facebook pixel — two pixels in two codes](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-two-pixels-code-1024x620.jpg)

Here’s a [detailed developer’s guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/accurate_event_tracking) for everyone who wants to create multiple pixels for Facebook ads launched by multiple agencies.

## How to Create a Facebook Pixel on the First Attempt

The first thing you should do is check your pixel and event code from A to Z to make sure you didn’t make any mistakes. After that, you can take advantage of these tools.

### The Test Events Tool

The Test Events tool allows you to make sure Facebook correctly receives your pixel events and fix all possible bugs that happen after you set up those events.

![Create a Facebook pixel — Test Events](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-test-events-1024x565.jpg)

To run this tool, click the **Test Events** tab in Events Manager. Then enter your website URL to open your website in a new window and start testing your events. Note that the Test Events tab must be open to conduct your test successfully. 

Once you start interacting with your website, the results will appear within 30 seconds. All test data remains for 24 hours or until you clear it. If your events don’t appear in the Test Events tab, turn off any ad blocking software, refresh your website, or try using a different browser.

### The Diagnostics Tool

You’ll find the Diagnostics tool in the tab to the right of the Test Events tab.   
The Diagnostics tool shows issues that may occur after you create a Facebook pixel for a website and offers solutions.

![Create a Facebook pixel — Diagnostics](/img/create-a-facebook-pixel-diagnostics-1024x565.jpg)

If you can’t handle a problem alone, you can click the **Send to Developer** button and delegate the task to one or several developers on your team.

### Facebook Pixel Helper

The Facebook Pixel Helper is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to know whether your pixel is completely installed, verify that your pixel works properly, receive troubleshooting suggestions, and improve pixel performance.
