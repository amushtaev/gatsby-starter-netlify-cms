Have something great you want to market but still aren’t sure about marketing objectives?

What are marketing objectives?

People set marketing objectives to successfully promote their products and services. In essence, marketing objectives are plans.

In the long run, marketing and planning go hand in hand.

Gartner reports that corporate marketers spend almost [22 hours per week](https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/marketing-strategy) planning their strategies, while business executives and their teams spend more than 10 hours a week doing the same.

Interestingly, more than [70% of professional marketers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/693269/marketing-strategy-effective/) worldwide believe their marketing strategies are effective according to Statista.

How do they succeed? They set the right objectives!

In this blog post, we’ll show you some marketing objective examples to help you explore your own business goals and create an effective strategy for your advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook, Instagram, and other major platforms.

## Marketing Objectives as a Concept

Let's start with marketing objectives and their definition.

*Marketing objectives are short-term goals set by a business during advertising campaigns that are aimed at promoting certain marketing activities such as products, services, news, events, publications, etc.*

Marketing objectives help a business move forward in a targeted direction to achieve a specific result that fulfills a specific goal at a specific point in a promotional strategy.

Most marketers differentiate marketing objectives from marketing goals, which are considered more general.

### Management by Objectives (MBO)

The father of marketing objectives is Peter Drucker, an Austrian-born American management consultant who introduced his management by objectives (MBO) concept in his 1954 book The Practice of Management.

In the preface to one of the [book’s later editions](https://books.google.com.ua/books/about/The_Practice_of_Management.html?id=D2QqCI-eZoIC&redir_esc=y), Drucker writes:

*The Practice of Management was the first book to talk of “objectives,” to define “key result areas,” to outline how to set objectives, and to describe how to use them to direct and steer a business and to measure its performance. Indeed The Practice of Management probably invented the term “objectives” — at least, it is not to be found in the earlier literature. And The Practice of Management was the first book to discuss both managing the existing business and innovating the business of tomorrow.*

Drucker distinguished [five major steps](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10634-peter-drucker-management-theory.html) to practicing management by objectives:

1. Review organizational goals
2. Set worker objectives
3. Monitor progress
4. Evaluate
5. Give rewards

Marketers associate Drucker’s MBO concept with so-called smart marketing objectives.

### The S.M.A.R.T. Way

In the November 1981 issue of the journal [Management Review](https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf), George T. Doran presented another management concept that made it easier to understand MBO.

In his article “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management’s goals and objectives,” Doran writes that “each corporate, department, and section objective should be:

* **Specific** — target a specific area for improvement.
* **Measurable** — quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
* **Assignable** — specify who will do it.
* **Realistic** — state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
* **Time-related** — specify when the result(s) can be achieved.”

Doran stresses that smart marketing objectives examples shouldn’t be taken at face value:

*Notice that these criteria don’t say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management… It should be also understood that the suggested acronym doesn’t mean that every objective written will have all five criteria.*

Still, he adds that the closer you get to the criteria, the smarter your objectives will be.

## Examples of Marketing Objectives in the Digital Age

If you don’t know your business’s marketing goals and objectives, it’s no big deal. The best way to start figuring this out is to create an account on one of the major digital advertising platforms (if you haven’t done so already).

Since [Google and Facebook](https://softcube.com/google-ads-ex-adwords-vs-facebook-ads/) are the world’s two largest ad platforms, we’re going to review the marketing objectives they offer to advertisers.

Let’s begin!

Once you start a new campaign in Google Ads, the platform will offer you six digital marketing objectives (or goals).
