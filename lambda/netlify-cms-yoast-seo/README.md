## Usage

Currently, assessment results are rendered within a CMS preview template. This means you will need custom preview templates for each of the collections you would like assessments on.

You will need to include the following 4 fields in each of your collections:

1. Title
2. Content
3. Focus Keyword
4. Meta Description

You can then use a custom preview template to render the assessment results as shown below:

```js
CMS.registerPreviewStyle('https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms-yoast-seo@~1.0/dist/main.css');

CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('page', createClass({
    render: function () {
        const entry = this.props.entry
        const title = entry.getIn(['data', 'title']) || ''

        YOAST.setContent({
            title: title,
            description: entry.getIn(['data', 'description']) || '',
            keyword: entry.getIn(['data', 'yoast_keyword']) || '',
            text: entry.getIn(['data', 'body']) || '',
            titleWidth: title.split('').length * 5 // 5px is an average width of each character ;)
        })

        return h('div', {},
            this.props.widgetFor('body'),
            YOAST.getScoresAsHTML(h)
        );
    }
}));
```
